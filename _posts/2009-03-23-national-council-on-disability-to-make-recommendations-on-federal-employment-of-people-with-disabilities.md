**WASHINGTON—**The National Council on Disability (NCD) will conduct a news conference to highlight the release of a policy paper examining the status of employment of people with disabilities in the Federal Government and making recommendations for improving federal hiring and advancement of employees with disabilities. The event will take place at 10:15 until 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday, March 31, 2009, at the Academy for Educational Development (AED), 1825 Connecticut Avenue, NW, 8th Floor Conference Center, Washington, DC.

NCD has determined that despite laws, regulations, policy guidance, and excepted service hiring authorities designed to promote federal employment opportunities for people with disabilities, barriers to federal employment remain, and the number of employees with disabilities in the federal workforce is still low.

Speakers include:

Susan Parker, Director of Policy Development, Office of Disability Employment Policy, US Department of Labor

This news conference is part of NCD's quarterly meeting, which is also being held at AED, beginning at 9:30 a.m. on Monday, March 30, 2009, and ending at 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday, April 1, 2009.

Specific times are designated to receive public comment, supported by a toll-free call-in line, and input is encouraged and greatly appreciated. Individuals or organizations can also provide written comments by e-mail, fax, or mail. Public comment sessions will be held Monday, March 30 from 11:30 a.m. until noon EDT, and on Tuesday, March 31 from 1 p.m. until 1:30 p.m. EDT. The toll-free call-in number is 888-790-6568, and the pass code is "NCD Meeting."

The purpose of NCD, an independent federal agency, is to promote programs, practices, policies and procedures that ensure full inclusion of people with disabilities into all aspects of society. NCD accomplishes this mission by providing advice and making recommendations to the President, Congress, governmental agencies, and other stakeholders.
