**For Immediate Release**

Nov. 5, 2024

**WASHINGTON–**Today Americans will head to the polls to take part in one of the most important rights--the right to vote.

On Thursday, Nov. 7 the National Council on Disability (NCD) invites the public to present public comment on their experiences during the Council's next virtual quarterly meeting.

During a 30-minute public comment session starting at 3:30 p.m. EST, the Council will receive perspectives on voting experiences in the Nov. 5, 2024 General Election. Commenters are encouraged to respond to the following prompts regarding their voting experience during the November 5, 2024 General Election:

1. Did you experience any accessibility issues when you voted? What were they?
2. If you did experience any accessibility issues when you voted, were the poll workers knowledgeable on how to assist so you could exercise your right to vote independently?

The public comment period provides an opportunity for NCD hear from you – individuals, businesses, providers, educators, parents and advocates.

Public comment guidelines are available on NCD’s public comment page at <https://www.ncd.gov/public-comment/>.

Those wanting to participate in public comment must preregister, either through indicating they want to provide public comment during the standard registration process for the meeting or by sending an email to publiccomment@ncd.gov by 8 p.m. EDT Nov. 6.

Because of the virtual format, the Council will receive public comment by email or by video or audio/phone over Zoom.

If any time remains following the conclusion of the comments of those registered, NCD may call upon those who desire to make comments on the topic but did not register.

The Council meeting is free and open to the public. Full information on the event and registration link can be found on our [upcoming meeting page](https://www.ncd.gov/meeting/2024-11-07-nov-7-2024-council-meeting/).

CART and ASL will be provided.
