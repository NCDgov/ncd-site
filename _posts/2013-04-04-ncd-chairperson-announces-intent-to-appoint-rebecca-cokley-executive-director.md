**WASHINGTON –**Today, Chairperson Jeff Rosen announces his intent to appoint Rebecca Cokley as the Executive Director of the National Council on Disability (NCD). Cokley previously served on NCD’s Youth Advisory Commission as Vice Chair during the George W. Bush administration.

Initially established in 1978 as an advisory board within the United States Department of Education to guarantee equal opportunity for persons with disabilities, in 1984, amendments to the Rehabilitation Act made NCD an independent federal agency. NCD has 15 Presidentially-appointed Council Members who live across the nation, and 11 professional staff based in Washington, DC. NCD promotes policies, programs, practices and procedures that further the objectives of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to ensure that Americans with disabilities have the same level of access to civic, social and economic participation as their non-disabled friends, family members and peers.

“As we near the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Rebecca’s appointment as Executive Director honors NCD’s history and builds on that foundation as we work toward a more inclusive and equitable future,” said Jeff Rosen, NCD’s Chairperson. “Her outstanding experience in disability policy work includes bringing different racial, ethnic, and religious groups, the LGBT community, veterans, and people with disabilities together to address common causes. Rebecca brings a proven track record to NCD’s efforts to ensure that the American Dream is accessible for the growing number of Americans with disabilities from diverse backgrounds with different needs and identities.”

Cokley comes to NCD after serving 4 years in the Obama Administration. Most recently, she was the Special Assistant to the Principal Deputy at the Administration for Community Living (ACL) at the US Department of Health and Human Services. Before serving at ACL, Cokley was the Director of Priority Placement for Public Engagement in the Presidential Personnel Office at the White House where she was responsible for outreach to diversity and minority organizations to recruit qualified individuals for roles in the Obama Administration. Prior to her time at the White House, Cokley was the Confidential Assistant to the Assistant Secretary for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services. She is also the proud spouse of Patrick and mother of Jackson.
