**WASHINGTON--**The National Council on Disability remembers former U.S. Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, 88, who died Saturday.

Hatch represented Utah from 1977 to 2019 and played an important role in passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

On July 13, 1990, the the Senate passed the bill on a vote of 91-6. President George H.W. Bush then signed it into law on July 26, 1990.

In 2008, Hatch, with Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, introduced the ADA Amendments Act that would be signed into law by President George W. Bush.

He said he considered passage of the ADA one of the most important things that he ever did in the Senate and in a [2020 op-ed](https://orrinhatchfoundation.org/oped-posts/americanswithdisabilitiesactanniversary), he reflected on the importance of it.

NCD remembers the service of Senator Hatch and sends condolences to the Hatch family.
