**Notice of Funding Opportunity**

**2022 Progress Report**

**Environmental Injustice and the Impact of the Increased Frequency of Extreme Weather Events on People with Disabilities**

**Background and Statement of Problem**

In view of Executive Order 13990, “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis”; and Executive Order 14030, “Climate-Related Financial Risk” directing federal agencies to take a whole-of-Government approach to increase resilience to the impacts of climate change and protect public health, NCD’s annual, statutorily mandated 2022 progress report will address the impacts of climate change and environmental injustice on the lives of people with disabilities.

Environmental injustice occurs when minority groups and/or people living in poverty are excluded from environmental decision-making or are disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards.[1](https://ncd.gov/#_ftn1) People with disabilities represent 15% of the world’s population and as the increased frequency of extreme weather events and other environmental issues increase, the disability community disproportionately absorbs the impact.[2](https://ncd.gov/#_ftn2) According to a 2020 United Nations report, people with disabilities are at increased risk of the adverse impacts of climate change, including threats to their health, food security, water, sanitation and, livelihoods.[3](https://ncd.gov/#_ftn3)

Sudden onset of natural disasters and slow onset events can seriously affect a person with a disability’s access to food and nutrition, safe drinking water, sanitation, healthcare services and medicines, education and training, adequate housing, and employment.[4](https://ncd.gov/#_ftn4)

In NCD’s soon to be released report *Disparate Treatment of Puerto Rican Residents with Disabilities in Federal Programs,* NCD reported on the mass migration of Puerto Rican residents to the states, with one of the main reasons of the migration being to escape the economic hardship on the island created by the multiple natural disasters over the last several decades. This migration has resulted in a shortage of medical doctors, educators, and professionals and an exacerbation of economic hardship given the resulting diminished tax base. Many people with disabilities, because of their economic status are unable to flee unfavorable conditions caused by such natural disasters.

Here in the United States, in February 2021, during winter storm Uri, which caused the blackout for over 9.9 million people in the United States and Mexico, and triggered a power crisis in Texas, 75% of Texans with disabilities were without electricity for at least 24 hours, 22% were without power for more than four days. Residents with disabilities experienced spoilage of life-saving medication and the inability to use breathing devices or mobility equipment that were power dependent.[5](https://ncd.gov/#_ftn5) There has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, people with disabilities have had higher rates of illness, injuries, or death from these types of events than people without disabilities.[6](https://ncd.gov/#_ftn6) When an extreme weather event requires evacuation, people with disabilities have a high risk of being impacted both physically and mentally. The increased frequency of hurricanes, fires, and floods has a direct impact on people with disabilities who are power dependent. California, a state known for its rolling brownouts and power outages due to wildfires, continues to search for ways to mitigate the impact of power outages for people with disabilities who are power dependent.

Disability status in combination with race, ethnicity, and income is a determinant as to the amount of environmental harm one is exposed to.[7](https://ncd.gov/#_ftn7) People with disabilities, especially people of color are more likely to be impoverished, forcing them into low-income housing, which makes their residence more likely to be built near pollution sites.[8](https://ncd.gov/#_ftn8) Houston neighborhoods located near pollution sources such as Superfund sites and hazardous waste facilities were home to a significantly higher proportion of people with disabilities compared to the rest of the city. Race, ethnicity, and age amplified these inequalities.[9](https://ncd.gov/#_ftn9) Pollution and unsafe jobs and environmentally destructive industries not only affect health, but they also cause permanent disabilities.[10](https://ncd.gov/#_ftn10)

Environmental injustice is more prevalent in indigenous communities. Environmental injustice against Native Americans occurs, in part, because of social and economic injustice. In a study of the relationship between proximity to hazardous waste sites and occurrence of birth defects among 28,401 individuals born in California from 1983 to 1988, the strongest association between toxic exposure and congenital defects was found among Native American populations. The proximity to soil lead and lead dust pollution from mining waste poses a more significant health concern for American Indians than any other population. Environmental injustice also occurs in the planning stages of hazardous waste sites, which targeted Native American lands without any input from the population.[11](https://ncd.gov/#_ftn11)

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 24% of American Indian and Alaska Natives have a disability compared to just 19% of the general population.

Native coastal communities in Alaska have been impacted by the rise in sea level. They had to abandon their community and relocate on higher ground after experiencing more extreme storm surges, flooding, and sea level rise, which has impacted cultural integrity and access to vital resources.[12](https://ncd.gov/#_ftn12)

**Report Purpose**

The Purpose of this report is to identify how the increased frequency of extreme weather events and environmental injustice impacts people with disabilities in the United States and in its territories. The report should identify the primary issues people with disabilities encounter because of the increased prevalence of natural disasters and environmental change. This report should also address how environmental injustice has a greater impact on people of color and indigenous tribes leading to an increased prevalence of disability in their community, further complicating these targeted population’s ability to mitigate the impact of increasing and extreme natural disasters. This report will address the impact of the increased frequency of extreme weather events on a person with a disability’s health and access to healthcare, community, housing, employment, and education. The report will also look at the higher prevalence of emergency evacuations, power outages, and their impact on people with disabilities.

The report will gather data and evidence to identify the specific issues people with disabilities encounter due to the impact of the increased frequency of extreme weather events and economic injustice. Specifically, the impact, on a person with a disability’s health, access to food, housing, water and sanitation, education, access to the community, and employment. This report will offer recommendations on how to mitigate the impact of the increased frequency of extreme weather events and environmental injustice on persons with disabilities. This report will discuss the intersectionality of disability and how the individual’s specific intersectionality impacts their ability to mitigate and access resources to mitigate the impact of environmental injustice or the increased frequency of extreme weather events.

**Research Questions**

Through the lens of disability right laws, the research will seek to answer:

1. How has the increased frequency of extreme weather events and environmental injustice impacted the health and access to health care for people with disabilities?
2. How has the increased frequency of extreme weather events and environmental injustice impacted persons with a disability access to their community?
3. How has the increased frequency of extreme weather events and environmental injustice impacted housing options for people with disabilities?
4. How has the increased frequency of extreme weather events and environmental injustice impacted or exacerbate job opportunities for people with disabilities?
5. How has the increased frequency of extreme weather events and environmental injustice impacted access to food, fresh water, and sanitation for people with disabilities?
6. What actions can be taken to mitigate the findings garnered from the research of this report?

**About the National Council on Disability**

Overview and Purpose

The National Council on Disability (NCD) is an independent federal agency comprised of a team of Presidential and Congressional appointees, an Executive Director appointed by the Chair, and a full-time professional staff. The purpose of NCD is to promote policies, programs, practices, and procedures that guarantee equal opportunity for all people with disabilities regardless of the nature or significance of the disability and to empower people with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of society.

Specific Duties

NCD’s statutory duties are set forth at 29 USC §781, and include:

(1) provide advice to the Director with respect to the policies and conduct of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research, including ways to improve research concerning individuals with disabilities and the methods of collecting and disseminating findings of such research;

(2) provide advice to the Commissioner with respect to the policies of and conduct of the Rehabilitation Services Administration;

(3) advise the President, the Congress, the Commissioner, the appropriate Assistant Secretary of the Department of Education, and the Director of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research on the development of the programs to be carried out under this chapter;

(4) provide advice regarding priorities for the activities of the Interagency Disability Coordinating Council and review the recommendations of such Council for legislative and administrative changes to ensure that such recommendations are consistent with the purposes of the Council to promote the full integration, independence, and productivity of individuals with disabilities;

(5) review and evaluate on a continuing basis—

(A) policies, programs, practices, and procedures concerning individuals with disabilities conducted or assisted by Federal departments and agencies, including programs established or assisted under this chapter or under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 \[42 U.S.C. 15001 et seq.]; and

(B) all statutes and regulations pertaining to Federal programs which assist such individuals with disabilities; in order to assess the effectiveness of such policies, programs, practices, procedures, statutes, and regulations in meeting the needs of individuals with disabilities;

(10) review and evaluate on a continuing basis new and emerging disability policy issues affecting individuals with disabilities at the Federal, State, and local levels, and in the private sector, including the need for and coordination of adult services Access to personal assistance services, school reform efforts and the impact of such efforts on individuals with disabilities, access to health care, and policies that operate as disincentives for the individuals to seek and retain employment; and

Preparing and submitting to the President and Congress an annual report titled National Disability Policy: A Progress Report.

International

In 1995, NCD was designated by the Department of State to be the U.S. government’s official contact point for disability issues. Specifically, NCD interacts with the special rapporteur of the United Nations Commission for Social Development on disability matters.

Consumers Served and Current Activities

Although many government agencies deal with issues and programs affecting people with disabilities, NCD is the only federal agency charged with addressing, analyzing, and making recommendations on issues of public policy that affect people with disabilities regardless of age, disability type, perceived employment potential, economic need, specific functional ability, veteran status, or other individual circumstance. NCD recognizes its unique opportunity to facilitate independent living, community integration, and employment opportunities for people with disabilities by ensuring an informed and coordinated approach to addressing the concerns of people with disabilities and eliminating barriers to their active participation in community and family life.

NCD plays a major role in developing disability policy in America. NCD originally proposed what eventually became the ADA. To see NCD’s present and past work on issues that are key to the lives of people with disabilities, visit www.ncd.gov.

Statutory History

NCD was established in 1978 as an advisory board within the Department of Health Education and Welfare (P.L.95-602). The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1984 (P.L. 98-221) established NCD as an independent agency.
