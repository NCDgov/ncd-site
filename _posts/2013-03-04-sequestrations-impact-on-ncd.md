**Wï»¿ASHINGTON--**On Friday, at midnight, sequestration's across-the-board federal budget cuts went into effect, including cuts to NCD's budget. As a result, NCD must suspend all discretionary travel and training and therefore will not be able to attend or host conferences or forums. NCD regrets that this may impact our ability to interact in-person with people with disabilities around the country. NCD will continue to hold its statutorily-required quarterly meetings, which are open to the public and include a public comment period. Our next such meeting is set for the end of April. Please check our website for dates and times as we get closer to April.
