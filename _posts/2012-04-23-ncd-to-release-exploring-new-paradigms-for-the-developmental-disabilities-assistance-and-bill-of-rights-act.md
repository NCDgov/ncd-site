**WASHINGTON —** On April 23, the National Council on Disability will preview findings of their latest report "Exploring New Paradigms for the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act," at the Disability Policy Seminar in Washington, DC. The Disability Policy Seminar is a 500+ participant advocacy seminar hosted by the Arc, United Cerebral Palsy, the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, the Association of University Centers on Disabilities, the National Association of Councils on Developmental Disabilities, and Self Advocates Becoming Empowered. 

The full report will be available on NCD's website on Tuesday, April 24 at [www.ncd.gov](https://www.ncd.gov/). 

"Exploring New Paradigms" builds on previous recommendations made by NCD and makes a case for better alignment of systems and statutes both within and beyond the scope of the DD Act. The report calls for more unified federal policies to deliver on the full potential of the DD Act and to provide individuals with ID/DD with the information, skills, opportunities, and support needed to:

* make informed choices and decisions about their lives;
* live in their own homes and communities with interdependent friendships and relationships;
* live free of abuse, neglect, financial and sexual exploitation, and violations of their legal and human rights;
* pursue meaningful, productive lives expressing their full rights as citizens; and
* contribute to their families, their communities, their states, and the nation

"The recommendations outlined in 'Exploring New Paradigms' are born of the latest trends, developments, challenges, and achievements of the DD Act since its last reauthorization in 2000," said Ari Ne'eman, Chair of NCD's Policy and Program Evaluation Committee, who will be presenting the findings as part of the Disability Policy Seminar.  "Individual interviews with self-advocates, families, researchers, practitioners, and state and federal government officials inform NCD's recommendations," continued Mr. Ne'eman.  "Independent focus groups from fifteen states rounded out the process, all highlighting the need for better integration of supports across an individual's lifespan to ensure full inclusion in society." 

**About the National Council on Disability:** NCD is a small, independent federal agency comprised of 15 Presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed Council Members and a small staff, who advise the President, Congress and other federal agencies on disability policy, programs, practices, and procedures.
