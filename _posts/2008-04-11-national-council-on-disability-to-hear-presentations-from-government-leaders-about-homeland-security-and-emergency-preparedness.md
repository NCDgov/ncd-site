In 2003, NCD committed to evaluating government's developing role in the areas of homeland security, emergency preparedness and disaster relief for people with disabilities. This commitment occurred, in large measure, as a result of the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent creation of DHS. NCD's first evaluation findings were issued in April 2005 in the report, *Saving Lives: Including People with Disabilities in Emergency Planning*. ([/newsroom/publications/2005/saving_lives.htm](https://ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/2005/saving_lives.htm)).

Under the Homeland Security Appropriations bill (H.R. 5441), signed by President Bush on October 4, 2006, NCD was assigned key responsibilities for disability-related issues in homeland security.

The homeland security and emergency preparedness discussions are part of NCD's quarterly meeting that begins on Monday, April 21 at 8:30 a.m. and concludes on Wednesday, April 23 at 12:30 p.m. at the Westin Arlington Gateway in Arlington, VA.

NCD is an independent federal agency and is composed of 15 members appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. We provide advice to the President, Congress, and executive branch agencies to promote policies, programs, practices, and procedures that guarantee equal opportunity for all individuals with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of the disability; and empower individuals with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of society.
