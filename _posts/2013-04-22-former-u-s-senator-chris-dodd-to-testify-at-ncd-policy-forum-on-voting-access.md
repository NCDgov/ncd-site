**WASHINGTON, DC** -- The National Council on Disability (NCD) – an independent federal agency that advises the President, Congress and other federal agencies on disability policy -- will use its statutory authority to receive testimony by holding a public policy forum on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, April 23 to examine the current state of voting access for people with disabilities. The event will include testimony from the author of the law, federal agency representatives, the Administration, and the disability civil rights community.

Former United States Senator Chris Dodd, author of the Help America Vote Act, is scheduled to provide testimony and receive questions. Senator Dodd served in the United States Congress representing Connecticut for 36 years – six years in the House of Representatives and thirty years in the U.S. Senate.

Through his tireless leadership securing passage of HAVA, Senator Dodd fought for a simple yet profound truth: in the United States of America, every voter – including voters with disabilities -- should have an equal opportunity to vote privately and independently, and that vote should be counted.

In addition to Senator Dodd, the event will include testimony from representatives of federal agencies, the Administration, and the disability civil rights community.

This event is open to the public. The event will be held in Dirksen Senate 608 beginning at 2:00 PM. Those planning to attend should schedule an additional 30 minutes for long lines at security and to get settled into the room before the event starts. Those unable to join in person can follow the proceedings live on Twitter using the hashtag #NCDVote.

**ACCOMMODATIONS:** CART and sign language interpreters will be provided. If additional accommodations are required, please contact Anne Sommers at NCD as soon as possible at [ASommers@ncd.gov](mailto:ASommers@ncd.gov). The location of accessible entrances for the Dirksen Senate Office Building is at the corner of First Street, NE, and C Street, NE.
