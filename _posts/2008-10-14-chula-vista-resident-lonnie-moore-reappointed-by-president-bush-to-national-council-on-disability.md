**WASHINGTON—**Lonnie Moore, a resident of Chula Vista, California, was reappointed by President George W. Bush to serve as a member of the National Council on Disability (NCD) ([www.ncd.gov](https://ncd.gov/ "/")). The U.S. Senate reconfirmed Mr. Moore's nomination on October 2, 2008.

Mr. Moore currently serves as a Program Analyst for the Army Warrior Transition Office, where he writes policy and makes recommendations to improve care and transition for wounded and ill soldiers. He also serves as the Western Chair for the Secretary of Veteran's Affairs Service Members and Families Council. Mr. Moore was combat-wounded in Iraq, where he led more than 60 combat missions.

NCD is an independent federal agency and is composed of 15 members appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. It provides advice to the President, Congress, and executive branch agencies to promote policies, programs, practices, and procedures that guarantee equal opportunity for all individuals with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of the disability and to empower individuals with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of society.
