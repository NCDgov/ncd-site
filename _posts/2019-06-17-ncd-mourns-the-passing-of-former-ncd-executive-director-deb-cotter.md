**WASHINGTON--**The National Council on Disability (NCD) mourns the passing of Deb Cotter, 51, who passed away June 17, in Washington, D.C. Deb was the Executive Director of NCD from December 2017 to March 2018.

Deb came to NCD directly from the Administration for Community Living in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, where she worked on the Independent Living Programs team since 2009, when the Program was housed at the U.S. Department of Education. Prior to joining the federal workforce, Ms. Cotter served as a Legislative Aide to Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine; as a Senior Legislative Assistant at the American Psychological Association; and as a Policy Analyst with the National Council on Independent Living.

Deb brought with her to NCD her undisputed commitment to disability rights, her reputation for being a hard worker, her ability to infuse levity into every situation, and her valuable range of professional experiences from her congressional, nonprofit advocacy, and regulatory work history.

Former NCD Chair Clyde Terry stated, “Deb’s passing is tremendously sad. Deb was the real deal – a tried and true advocate for improving the lives of people with disabilities. She sincerely wanted to be a part of advancing the goals of the ADA, and it really showed. She was committed to making a difference in all she took on. She will be greatly, greatly missed.”
