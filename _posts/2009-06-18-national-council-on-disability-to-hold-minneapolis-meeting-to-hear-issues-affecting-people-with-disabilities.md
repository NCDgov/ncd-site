**WASHINGTON—**The National Council on Disability (NCD) will conduct its next quarterly meeting at the Minneapolis Marriott City Center, 30 South 7th Street, Minneapolis, MN, beginning at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, July 20, 2009, and ending at 11:00 a.m. on Wednesday, July 22, 2009. All times are Central Daylight Time. This meeting is open to the public.

NCD believes it is vital to hear from communities around the country on what works and what does not for people with disabilities. This meeting will provide another opportunity for that exchange. The agenda will include, among other things, sessions on emergency preparedness, housing, workforce infrastructure, access to outdoor recreation, international development, the Developmental Disabilities and Bill of Rights Act, strategic planning, and NCD's 2010 National Summit on Disability Policy.

Specific times are also designated to receive public comment, supported by a toll-free call-in line, and input is encouraged and greatly appreciated. Individuals or organizations can also provide written comments by e-mail, fax, or mail. Public comment sessions will be held Monday, July 20, 11:30 a.m. until noon and on Tuesday, July 21, 4:30 p.m. until 5:00 p.m. The toll-free call-in number is (888) 790-6568, and the pass code is "NCD Meeting."

NCD will host a reception at the hotel from 5:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. immediately following the public comment session. Meeting participants, audience members, and disability community stakeholders are invited to attend.

The purpose of NCD, an independent federal agency, is to promote programs, practices, policies and procedures that ensure full inclusion of people with disabilities into all aspects of society. NCD accomplishes this mission by providing advice and making recommendations to the President, Congress, governmental agencies, and other stakeholders.
