**WASHINGTON—**[National Council on Disability (NCD)](https://ncd.gov/) Chairman Jonathan Young, announced today that Aaron Bishop of Washington, DC, will become NCD's new Executive Director on November 15. NCD is an independent federal agency charged with advising the President, Congress, and other federal officials and entities on all policies, programs, practices and procedures affecting people with disabilities. NCD's mission is to further the goals enshrined in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990: equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living and economic self-sufficiency for all people with disabilities.

According to Young, "NCD is delighted to have selected Aaron Bishop as its new Executive Director. Mr. Bishop, a well-respected disability advocate in his own right, comes to NCD directly from the United States Senate, where he has been on the Hill since 2003 and top disability policy adviser to Wyoming Senator Michael Enzi, who is the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions since 2005. His legislative background and disability expertise will be a very nice addition to the NCD staff. We look forward to working with Mr. Bishop. He holds great promise for NCD."

"We also want to thank Joan Durocher for serving as NCD's interim Executive Director until a permanent director could be chosen. Ms. Durocher has been promoted to NCD's General Counsel and Director of Policy," Young said.
