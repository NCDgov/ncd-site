**WASHINGTON, D.C. --** Today, the National Council on Disability (NCD) – an independent federal agency – released a report calling for the phase-out of a provision in the Fair Labor Standards Act, known as the 14(c) program, that allows employers who receive a certificate from the U.S. Department of Labor, to pay less than federal minimum wage to workers with disabilities for work performed.

The central theme of the recommendations in the report is the gradual phase-out of the 14(c) program, and accompanying systems change to enhance existing resources and create new mechanisms for supporting individuals in securing integrated employment. The net outcome of implementing these recommendations is to improve opportunities for persons with disabilities in line with the goals of the Americans with Disabilities Act for equality of opportunity, economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and full participation in all aspects of society.

NCD recognizes that its recommendations impact thousands of individuals and their families. NCD further recognizes that it will take support from many stakeholders to eliminate the discriminatory practices of the 14(c) program and build a sustainable supported employment infrastructure along with other supports.

This fall, as a step toward accomplishing these goals and to create momentum for the system change that is necessary, NCD plans to draft proposed legislation.
