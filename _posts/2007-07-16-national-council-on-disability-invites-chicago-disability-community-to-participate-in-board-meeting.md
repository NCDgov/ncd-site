**WASHINGTON**—The National Council on Disability (NCD) today invited the Chicago disability community to participate in NCD's Chicago quarterly board meeting, which will take place July 24–26 at the Crowne Plaza Chicago Metro, 733 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois.

According to NCD chairperson John R. Vaughn, "We believe it is vital that NCD hears from disability communities around the country on what works and what does not for people with disabilities. We are delighted to have the opportunity to visit Chicago and learn first hand about the experiences of people with disabilities from Illinois and the surrounding states. Please save the date and do not miss this opportunity to meet NCD board members and staff and offer your comments during the public comment sessions."

Public comment sessions will take place on July 24 at 9:45 a.m., July 25 at 9:00 a.m., and July 26 at 9:00 a.m. All times are Central Daylight Time (CDT).

A public news conference to release two reports on the Americans with Disabilities Act will take place on Thursday, July 26 at 9:30 a.m. CDT.

These meetings are free of charge and open to the public. People with disabilities are encouraged to attend and participate in the daily public comment segments of the meeting.

NCD is an independent federal agency and is composed of 15 members appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. It provides advice to the President, Congress, and executive branch agencies to promote policies, programs, practices, and procedures that guarantee equal opportunity for all individuals with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of the disability and to empower individuals with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of society.
