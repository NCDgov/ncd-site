FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**WASHINGTON—**The National Council on Disability (NCD) has sent recommendations to the White House regarding COVID-19 legislation needs for people with disabilities.

In a [letter](https://ncd.gov/publications/2021/ncd-letter-president-biden-regarding-covid-19-legislation) to President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. from NCD Chairman Andrés Gallegos, NCD addressed the urgent need for provisions considering the needs of persons with disabilities in the next COVID-19 legislative package.

“Without exaggeration, the lives of people with disabilities hang in the balance because their needs have not been addressed in any COVID–19 relief legislation to date,” wrote Chairman Gallegos. “NCD’s advice to you, Mr. President, and to federal policymakers on matters that affect people with disabilities is based upon objective research and analysis.”

This is NCD’s third letter to federal leaders with advice to include provisions to address the critical needs of people with disabilities during and after the pandemic in COVID relief legislation.

NCD brings attention to five specific needs in its current letter: Medicaid funds for home-and community-based services (HCBS); long-term funding and reauthorization of the Money Follows the Person (MFP) program; assisting people with disabilities to transition out of congregate settings into HCBS; assisting families who must stay home from work to provide care for adult children with disabilities; and access to personal protective equipment (PPE) for family and professional caregivers of people with disabilities.

“The needs of persons with disabilities during the pandemic cannot be overlooked or ignored any longer,” wrote Chairman Gallegos. “Respectfully, we urge you to address their needs appropriately and thoroughly in the next round of COVID-19 relief legislation.”
