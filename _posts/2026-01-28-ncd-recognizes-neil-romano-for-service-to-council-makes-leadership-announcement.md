**For Immediate Release** 

January 28, 2026                                      

**WASHINGTON –** The National Council on Disability (NCD) recognized Councilmember and former Chairman Neil Romano during the January 23 meeting in Orlando, Florida.

NCD Acting Chairman Shawn Kennemer presenting a public service award to Romano also announced the former chairman would again take up a leadership role, becoming the new Vice Chairman for the Council.

"We came to Orlando because our Councilmember Neil Romano, sitting here--who I adore and am proud to look up to him and his accomplishments--has been on the Council for 10 years," said Acting Chairman Kennemer.

In his time before NCD, Romano had run for Congress; served as director of communications for the White House Office of Drug Abuse Policy during President Ronald Reagan's administration; assistant secretary of labor, leading the Office of Disabilities Employment Policy (ODEP) during President George W. Bush's administration; and was nominated for an Emmy for his film for best director, Youth Homicide:  A Public Health Crisis.

In 2015, U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky appointed him to NCD. In 2018, Romano was reappointed to the Council, then President Trump designated him as Chairman, a role he would serve in until 2021.  

"He continued from 2015 to play a massive role in helping this mission and shaping the policies that we represent to Congress and to the White House," said Kennemer.

"Since this is where he now calls home, we wanted to take this opportunity to recognize him here in Orlando and thank him for his (over) 10 years of service to the Council and to the United States," said Kennemer.

Kennemer before presenting the award made one other announcement.

"Last week I asked Neil to be the Vice Chair for the National Council, and he accepted," said Kennemer.

Council members and staff gave congratulations to the vice chairman on his service.

"It's not too many people that can change my thoughts on certain topic," said Councilmember Theo Braddy. "I'm like a rock when I have a particular feel for something or thoughts for something, but I have learned over the time working with Neil to listen to him," he said. "And he has, to my surprise, changed my position on stuff; not too many people can do that."

"I've appreciated working with you," said Councilmember Sascha Bittner, "and I especially appreciate how you focus on advocacy within the medical community.  It's such a critical issue and I really appreciate that you're laser focused on it."

"As the newest member of the Council, I just want to say thank you; I've already learned a tremendous amount from you," said Councilmember Kimberly Hill Ridley. "I am exceptionally grateful that this is not an award because you have decided to leave the Council," she said with a smile.  "Congratulations, and I'm so grateful to continue working with you."

"This is an incredible honor today because of how I respect every single person in this room," said Romano.  "That doesn't necessarily mean we always got along or every decision was agreed upon, but by the grace of God, we've had a single goal, and NCD has had a single goal--I have been so proud to be part of that, to be able to push forward every day," he said. "We don't come here to ever talk about anything but the rights and the needs of people with disabilities."

Romano continued on his experience serving on the Council.

"I've worked with a lot of Council Members over the years, and I have yet to sit here and ever see a Councilmember or person who is ever doing anything for self-serving purposes, anything they did, except for people with disabilities.  And I have to tell you, it is a great pride in my life to work with these folks."

On being asked to serve as vice chairman of the Council, Romano reflected and responded to Kennemer.

"I would like to thank you, Mr. Chairman. he continued. "When you called a couple of weeks ago to say you wanted to talk to me, I thought you were going to say, 'Hey, Neil, you're fired," he said. "I'm greatly honored and for as long as I'm allowed or I can, I will be working for NCD on behalf of people with disabilities, and I appreciate it."

"Thank you all and God bless you all," he said.

NCD is an independent federal agency responsible for making recommendations on national disability policy to Congress, the President, his administration, state, local and Tribal governments.
