**For Immediate Release** 

January 28, 2026                                      

**WASHINGTON –** The National Council on Disability (NCD) recognized Councilmember and former Chairman Neil Romano during the January 23 meeting in Orlando, Florida.

Acting Chairman Shawn Kennemer presenting the public service award to Romano also announced the former chairman would again take up a leadership role, becoming the new Vice Chairman for the Council.

"Being the Acting Chair of the NCD, it's my pleasure to present the following, said Chairman Kennemer.  

Just a little bit of background.  We came to Orlando because our Council Member Neil Romano, sitting here, who I adore and am proud to look up to him and his accomplishments, has been on the Council for 10 years and he has served as the Chair, but I'm going to give you a little history.  I had the pleasure of running some history.  This is part of his history that I didn't even know until I did this research.

Romano ran for Congress out of New Jersey in 1984.  While he was not successful, he was then appointed to the Director of Communications for the White House Office of Drug Abuse Policy.

Under that, he was instrumental in the "Just Say No" policy -- stop me if I'm wrong on any of this -- and the America response to AIDS policy under the Reagan Administration and was a right-hand person for Nancy Reagan.

He was nominated in 2007 by George W. Bush and unanimously confirmed to be the head of the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Disabilities Employment Policy, ODEP.

In 2010 he was nominated for an Emmy for his film for best director, Youth Homicide:  A Public Health Crisis.

In 2015, U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky appointed him to NCD.

In 2018, President Trump designated him as the new Chairman of the Council.  



"He continued from 2015 to play a massive role in helping this mission and shaping the policies that we represent to Congress and to the White House."

"Since this is where he now calls home, we wanted to take this opportunity to recognize him here in Orlando and thank him for his 10 years of service to the Council and to the United States," said Kennemer.

At this time, we have an award for him that I'm going to read what it says.  A token of our appreciation.

It says:  In gratitude to Neil Romano for 10 years of devoted public service, devoted to the National Council on Disability, 2026.

Neil, at this time, we thank you for this.  I want to present this to you.

SHAWN KENNEMER:  One other thing I wanted to point out, just last week I asked Neil to be the Vice Chair for the National Council, and he accepted so he is now the Acting Vice Chair for this National Council.

And then right now I want to open it up to the staff at the National Council who have worked with Neil for their remarks if they have anything.

And Theo, oh, sorry, we'll wait for Theo to please --

NEIL ROMANO:  I'm in trouble now.

THEO BRADDY:  Can you hear me?

SHAWN KENNEMER:  We got you.

THEO BRADDY:  All right.  I couldn't let this moment go by.  Neil is my guy, right?  Neil is, you know, he don't put out his accomplishments out there.  You don't wear them on his sleeves.  He just have quietly done this stuff for so long.

And I just wanted to say to you, Neil, how much I appreciate you, how much I look to you for advice and counsel.  Right?

It's not too many people that can change my thoughts on certain topic, right?  I'm like a rock when I have a particular feel for something or thoughts for something, but I have learned over the time working with Neil to listen to him.  And he have, to my surprise, changed my position on stuff.  Not too many people can do that.

So Neil, I just want to let you know that you are someone I highly respect and look towards, and I just appreciate who you are.

So please, don't ever change.  So congratulations.

NEIL ROMANO:  Thank you.

SHAWN KENNEMER:  Thank you.

Sascha.

SASCHA BITTNER:  Yeah.  I just wanted to say that I've appreciated working with you.  And I especially appreciate how you focus on advocacy within the medical community.  As we just mentioned, it's such a critical issue.  And I really appreciate that you're laser focused on it.
