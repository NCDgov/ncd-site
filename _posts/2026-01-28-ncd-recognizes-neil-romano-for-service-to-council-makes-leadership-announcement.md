**For Immediate Release** 

January 28, 2026                                      

**WASHINGTON –** The National Council on Disability (NCD) recognized Councilmember and former Chairman Neil Romano during the January 23 meeting in Orlando, Florida.

Acting Chairman Shawn Kennemer presenting a public service award to Romano also announced the former chairman would again take up a leadership role, becoming the new Vice Chairman for the Council.

"Being the Acting Chair of the NCD, it's my pleasure to present the following, said Chairman Kennemer.  

Just a little bit of background.  We came to Orlando because our Council Member Neil Romano, sitting here, who I adore and am proud to look up to him and his accomplishments, has been on the Council for 10 years and he has served as the Chair, but I'm going to give you a little history.  I had the pleasure of running some history.  This is part of his history that I didn't even know until I did this research.

Romano ran for Congress out of New Jersey in 1984.  While he was not successful, he was then appointed to the Director of Communications for the White House Office of Drug Abuse Policy.

Under that, he was instrumental in the "Just Say No" policy -- stop me if I'm wrong on any of this -- and the America response to AIDS policy under the Reagan Administration and was a right-hand person for Nancy Reagan.

He was nominated in 2007 by George W. Bush and unanimously confirmed to be the head of the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Disabilities Employment Policy, ODEP.

In 2010 he was nominated for an Emmy for his film for best director, Youth Homicide:  A Public Health Crisis.

In 2015, U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky appointed him to NCD.

In 2018, President Trump designated him as the new Chairman of the Council.  



"He continued from 2015 to play a massive role in helping this mission and shaping the policies that we represent to Congress and to the White House."

"Since this is where he now calls home, we wanted to take this opportunity to recognize him here in Orlando and thank him for his 10 years of service to the Council and to the United States," said Kennemer.

At this time, we have an award for him that I'm going to read what it says.  A token of our appreciation.

It says:  In gratitude to Neil Romano for 10 years of devoted public service, devoted to the National Council on Disability, 2026.

Neil, at this time, we thank you for this.  I want to present this to you.

"Last week I asked Neil to be the Vice Chair for the National Council, and he accepted so he is now the Acting Vice Chair for this National Council," said Kennemer.

Council members and staff gave congratulations to the vice chairman on his service.

Councilmember Theo Braddy: "It's not too many people that can change my thoughts on certain topic," said Braddy.  I'm like a rock when I have a particular feel for something or thoughts for something, but I have learned over the time working with Neil to listen to him," he said. And he has, to my surprise, changed my position on stuff; not too many people can do that.

So Neil, I just want to let you know that you are someone I highly respect and look towards, and I just appreciate who you are.

So please, don't ever change.  So congratulations.

"I've appreciated working with you," said Councilmember Sascha Bittner, "and I especially appreciate how you focus on advocacy within the medical community.  It's such a critical issue and I really appreciate that you're laser focused on it."





KIM RIDLEY:  "As the newest member of the Council, I just want to say thank you. I've already learned a tremendous amount from you.  I am exceptionally grateful that this is not an award because you have decided to leave the Council.  I was a little worried, I will admit, for a few minutes, so Shawn, thank you for clarifying.

I just want to say I am in awe of how you present yourself, how you present the issues that you're talking about and your career in general.  It's something that I think most of us never really go into and feel the same way.  Congratulations, and I'm so grateful to continue working with you.



NEIL ROMANO:  This is an incredible honor today because of how I respect every single person in this room.  That doesn't necessarily mean we always got along or every decision was agreed upon.  But by the grace of God, we've had a single goal, and NCD has had a single goal, and I have been so proud to be part of that, to be able to push forward every day.  We don't come here to ever talk about anything but the rights and the needs of people with disabilities.

"I've worked with a lot of Council Members over the years, and I have yet to sit here and ever see a Council Member or person who is ever doing anything for self-serving purposes, anything they did, except for people with disabilities.  And I have to tell you, it is a great pride in my life to work with these folks."

"And I would like to thank you, Mr. Chairman. he continued. "When you called a couple of weeks ago to say you wanted to talk to me, I thought you were going to say, 'Hey, Neil, you're fired.," he said. "I'm greatly honored and for as long as I'm allowed or I can, I will be working for NCD on behalf of people with disabilities, and I appreciate it."

"Thank you all and God bless you all."
