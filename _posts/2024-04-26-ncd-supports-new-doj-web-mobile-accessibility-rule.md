**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

April 26, 2024

**WASHINGTON--**The National Council on Disability (NCD) – an independent federal agency – supports the U.S. Department of Justice action to publish its web and mobile app access rule.

The final rule, published in the [Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/24/2024-07758/nondiscrimination-on-the-basis-of-disability-accessibility-of-web-information-and-services-of-state), updates regulations for Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), mandating web and mobile applications (apps) are accessible to people with disabilities. Title II of the ADA applies to State and local government entities.

U.S. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland signed the rule April 8, it became effective April 24, and it will be enforced starting in 2026 or 2027 depending on government size.

Title II provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity.

It extends the prohibition on discrimination established by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to all activities of State and local government entities regardless of whether the entities receive federal financial assistance.

The rule establishes technical standards for web content and mobile app accessibility to give public entities greater clarity in exactly how to meet their ADA obligations and to help ensure equal access to government services for individuals with disabilities. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, or WCAG 2.1, will be the technical standard for web content and mobile app accessibility under Title II.

"As someone who works in the technology sector and as a deaf woman, I know how essential accessibility is in our increasingly digital world,” said NCD Chair Claudia Gordon. “This DOJ final rule brings long-overdue clarity on legal obligations, ensuring equal access for all and leaving no one behind."

NCD recommended and first drafted the ADA. It was signed by President George H.W. Bush on July 26, 1990. Since then, the agency has made extensive recommendations to policymakers regarding the implementation and enforcement of the law, including web accessibility.
