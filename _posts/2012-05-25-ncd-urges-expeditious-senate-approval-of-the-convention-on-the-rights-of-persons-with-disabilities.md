### **_Seven Senators pledge their support for U.S. ratification of the CRPD_**

M﻿ay 25, 2012

**WASHINGTON -** Today, seven United States Senators issued a statement of bipartisan support for United States ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

"The Convention was undertaken with the same goals as America had in enacting the ADA: to empower individuals with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of society. While we have fostered considerable progress through international collaborations, far too many people with disabilities languish under their countries' insufficient governmental frameworks.  Ratification of the CRPD will be a huge step forward in enhancing the lives of people with disabilities around the world," stated Joan Durocher, NCD's General Counsel and Director of Policy.

Ratification of the CRPD will allow U.S. participation at the CRPD Conference of States Parties and permit the U.S. to appoint a member of the CRPD Committee.  Through these mechanisms, the U.S. can influence guidance on the implementation of the treaty and lend its expertise as more countries develop their own disability rights laws.

Marylyn Howe, NCD Board Member, added, "In both our mandated advisory role and that of promoting policy that enhances the lives of people with disabilities, the National Council on Disability (NCD) was pleased to support the efforts of the United States throughout the development of the Convention."

By being a signatory to this historic document, and submitting it to the U.S. Senate for ratification, the United States provides its clear support for the principles of the Convention.  NCD urges the Senate to expeditiously ratify this historic treaty.  Upon ratification, the United States will join more than 140 other countries in committing themselves to protecting the rights of people with disabilities.
