**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

February 12, 2026

**WASHINGTON—** Today the National Council on Disability (NCD) welcomes its newest member to the independent federal agency charged with advising Congress, the President and federal agencies on disability policy.

Brian Patchett took the oath of office today and officially began his time as NCD Council member in a ceremony presided over by NCD Acting Chairman Neil Romano.

“As we move forward, I’m really looking forward to working with you,” Romano told Patchett at the swearing in. “I think you’re going to bring tremendous experience (to the Council),” he said.

Patchett was appointed to the Council by Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on February 2 and replaces Acting Chairman Shawn Kennemer, who had been appointed in 2022. With Kennemer’s departure, Vice Chairman Romano became Acting Chairman.

Patchett joins Acting Chairman Romano and Councilmembers Hoskie Benally Jr., Sascha Bittner, Theo Braddy, Kimberly Hill Ridley, and Risa Jaz Rifkind.

“Each Council member brings a different lens by which to view the issues that NCD grapples with on a daily basis—different life experiences, different disabilities, different professional backgrounds,” said NCD Executive Director Ana Torres-Davis, who moderated the ceremony.

“For me this is about helping people with disabilities become more independent every day,” said Patchett upon taking the oath. I’m really honored to be part of NCD because I see what has been accomplished and what can be accomplished, he said.

Appointments to NCD are made by the President of the United States, the Senate Majority Leader, the Senate Minority Leader, the Speaker of the House, and the House Minority Leader pursuant to Section 451 of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (Pub. L. 113–128).

**About the National Council on Disability (NCD):**

First established as a small advisory Council within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare Rehabilitation in 1978, NCD became an independent federal agency in 1984. In 1986, NCD recommended enactment of an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and drafted the first version of the bill which was introduced in the House and Senate in 1988. Since the ADA became law in 1990, NCD has continued to play a leading role in crafting policy solutions, and in advising the President, Congress and other federal agencies on disability policies, programs, and practices.
