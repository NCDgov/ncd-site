**WASHINGTON—**The National Council on Disability (NCD) will conduct its next quarterly meeting at the New Orleans Marriott Convention Center, 859 Convention Center Boulevard, New Orleans, Louisiana, beginning January 28, 2008, at 11:00 a.m. and ending January 30 at 4:45 p.m. This meeting is open to the public and the media.

Public comment sessions will be held January 28 from 5:00 p.m. until 5:30 p.m. CST and on January 29 from 4:30 p.m. until 5:00 p.m. CST. The toll-free call-in number is 888-810-3951, and the pass code is "NCD Council Meeting." There will also be a reception at the hotel for all meeting participants, audience members, and people with disabilities from the community on January 29 from 5:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.

NCD is an independent federal agency and is composed of 15 members appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. We provide advice to the President, Congress, and executive branch agencies to promote policies, programs, practices, and procedures that: (A) guarantee equal opportunity for all individuals with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of the disability; and (B) empower individuals with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of society.

To carry out our purposes, we believe it is vital that NCD hears from disability communities around the country on what works and what does not for people with disabilities. Our agenda will include sessions on emergency preparedness, youth transition, healthcare, employment, and other subjects of interest to the disability community. We are delighted to have the opportunity to visit New Orleans and learn firsthand about the experiences of people with disabilities from the region. Please save the date and do not miss this opportunity to meet NCD board members and staff and offer your comments during the public comment sessions.
