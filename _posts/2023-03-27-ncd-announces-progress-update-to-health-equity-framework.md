**WASHINGTON--**The National Council on Disability recently published a progress update to its February 2022 Health Equity Framework.

Progress Update, Year One: Health Equity Framework for People with Disabilities gives a rundown of notable actions over the first year in advancing health equity.

The framework for policymakers called for an all-of-government approach to longstanding medical discrimination against people with disabilities, the largest unrecognized minority group in this country.

The framework presents five core foundational elements: the designation of people with disabilities as a Special Medically Underserved Population; a health disparities population designation; requiring comprehensive disability clinical-care curricula for medical providers; accessible medical diagnostic equipment; and improved data capturing; and then offers 38 additional components.

The update is available on the [Health Equity Framework page](https://www.ncd.gov/report/framework-to-end-health-disparities-of-people-with-disabilities/) at NCD.gov.
