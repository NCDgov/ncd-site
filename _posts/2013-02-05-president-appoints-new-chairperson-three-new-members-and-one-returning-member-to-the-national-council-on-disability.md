**WASHINGTON, D.C. —** The National Council on Disability (NCD) – an independent federal agency that advises the President, Congress and other federal agencies regarding disability policy – is proud to welcome Jeff Rosen as its new Chairperson. The agency also welcomed three new members also appointed by President Barack Obama to the agency on January 31, 2013 after the intention of their appointment was announced January 25. In addition, Council Member Chester Finn was appointed to a second term. New Members are expected to begin work with NCD immediately upon completion and receipt of all necessary documents.

New NCD members are: **Jeff Rosen (Chairperson), Captain Jonathan F. Kuniholm, USMC (Retired), Lynnae Ruttledge and Alice Wong.** They join **Janice Lehrer-Stein, Chester Finn (reappointed), Gary Blumenthal, Sara Gelser, Matan Koch, Ari Ne'eman, Kamilah Oni Martin-Proctor, Stephanie Orlando, Clyde Terry, Dr. Fernando M. Torres-Gil, and Pamela Young-Holmes**, who were previously appointed by the President. Biographies for the new Council Members are provided at the end of this release.

NCD extends its gratitude to the outgoing Members for their public service: **outgoing Chairman Jonathan Young, Lonnie Moore, Dongwoo Joseph "Joe" Pak, and Linda Wetters**.

"I am honored to serve as Chair of the National Council on Disability and join an outstanding group of Council Members," stated NCD's new Chairperson Jeff Rosen. The appointment is a homecoming, of sorts, for Rosen. He previously served as the General Counsel and Director of Policy of the agency. During his previous seven-year tenure at NCD, Rosen helped the Council carry out its policy and research work through three principal conceptual frameworks: The Civil Rights Monitoring Project; Investing in Independence; and Livable Communities. He also led the agency’s Righting the ADA project, which served as the foundation for the ADA Amendments Act of 2008.

"NCD has long seen itself as the voice of people with disabilities in the Federal Government," said incoming NCD Chairperson Jeff Rosen. ”In close collaboration with the Administration, Congress and disability stakeholders, NCD has promoted policies which have advanced equal opportunity, economic self-sufficiency, independent living, inclusion and integration into all aspects of society for individuals with disabilities. NCD is resolute about continuing its leadership role during a time where our nation is structuring and financing domestic programs of significance to people with disabilities and their families as well as engaging with disability globally such as through the U.N. Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.”
