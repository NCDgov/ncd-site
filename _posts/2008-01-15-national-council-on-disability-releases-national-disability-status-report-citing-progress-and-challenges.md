**WASHINGTON—**The National Council on Disability (NCD) today released its annual report, *National Disability Policy: A Progress Report* ([January2008/NationalDisabilityPolicy_A_Progress_Report](https://ncd.gov/progress_reports/01152008 "/newsroom/publications/2008/NationalDisabilityPolicy_A_Progress_Report.html")), noting progress where it has occurred and making further recommendations where necessary to the executive and legislative branches of the Federal Government.

According to NCD Chairperson John R. Vaughn, "NCD has observed many examples of continued progress in disability policy. Among these are the Help America Vote Act for increasing access to elections for Americans with disabilities, developments under the Assistive Technology Act that hold out the promise for enhanced coordination in the delivery of services, and the positive role of the Department of Justice in a recent Detroit public transit case. This is just some of the positive progress we note as a result of the Administration's leadership through the New Freedom Initiative."

"Notwithstanding this progress, many challenges remain for our citizens who are living with disabilities and who wish to be more independent, more productive, and more actively involved in their families and communities. Far too many Americans are desperately trying to improve the quality of their lives, but they are frustrated by a lack of affordable accessible housing, transportation, and long-term services and supports. NCD will continue to develop policy recommendations to address these issues." Vaughn concluded.

In the past year, NCD has undertaken and completed a number of projects that support the Administration's New Freedom Initiative and that respond to NCD's statutory mission. In particular, NCD has issued a series of policy evaluations and evidence-based studies that measure progress toward implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

NCD encourages all government agencies and Congress to use NCD's work as a reference point and source of data for recommendations and as a basis for further examination of issues that affect the lives of people with disabilities. NCD will continue to work with the Administration and Congress to ensure that every individual with a disability has access to the American dream.

NCD is an independent federal agency and is composed of 15 members appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. We provide advice to the President, Congress, and executive branch agencies to promote policies, programs, practices, and procedures that—\
(A) guarantee equal opportunity for all individuals with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of the disability; and\
(B) empower individuals with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of society.
