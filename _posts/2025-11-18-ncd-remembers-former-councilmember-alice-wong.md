**WASHINGTON--**The National Council on Disability remembers former Councilmember Alice Wong, 51, who passed away Nov. 14.

Alice served on the Council from 2013 through 2015. She was appointed by President Barack Obama on January 25, 2013.

NCD notes Alice's specifically unwavering dedication to advising policymakers for robust home and community based services.

Alice founded the [Disability Visibility Project](https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/) in 2014 and authored her memoir, "Year of the Tiger: An Activist’s Life," in 2022 that offered her experience as a disability advocate and storyteller.

During the 2015 White House celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Alice attended the event remotely via robot and livestreamed greeting attendees.

NCD joins the community in mourning her passing and remembering her treasured legacy of promoting the visibility and rights of people with disabilities.
