The National Council on Disability (NCD) invites the public to attend its next quarterly Council Meeting May 12, 12-4 p.m. ET via Zoom.

Registration is not required, but interested parties are encouraged to register to ensure on our [Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ncd-quarterly-meeting-may-12-2022-tickets-333367329657).

Full information on the event can also be found on our [Upcoming Events](https://ncd.gov/events/2022/upcoming-council-meeting) page.

Following welcome remarks and introductions, the Chairman and Executive Committee will provide reports; followed by a presentation on NCD's upcoming Progress Report; administrative policies training for the Council; legislative and public affairs updates; a review of policy proposals and vote; a presentation on chemical and electromagnetic sensitivities; any old or new business; and public comment on impacts of extreme weather events and environmental injustice on people with disabilities, before adjourning.

For the May 12 Council meeting, NCD will designate its half-hour of public comment exclusively for receiving information for its upcoming report that examines the impact of extreme weather events and environmental injustice on people with disabilities. In order to develop NCD's recommendations to policymakers, NCD invites you to share your insights in response to the following questions:

1. What are the barriers to accessing federal or state funding after a disaster? What needs to be improved?

2. With the increase of extreme weather events, what are the unique obstacles people with disabilities face in planning, response and recovery from these events?

3. What unforeseen obstacles will the disability community need to address because of the increase of extreme weather events? Recommendations on how those obstacles can be mitigated?

4. What role can the federal government play to mitigate the impact of extreme weather events on people with disabilities?

5. What impact has the lack of environmental justice had on communities, specifically, the prevalence of disability? Can you provide specific instances of the impact to these marginalized communities? (e.g. Territories and American Indian/Alaskan Native lands)

To provide comments or notice to present public comment, please send an email to [PublicComment@ncd.gov](mailto:PublicComment@ncd.gov) with the subject line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and topic of comment included in the body of your email. Submission should be received no later than May 11 to ensure inclusion.
