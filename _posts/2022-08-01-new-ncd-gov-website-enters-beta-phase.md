**For Immediate Release**

Aug. 1, 2022

**WASHINGTON--**The National Council on Disability announces a public preview of its new website.

The site, located at [beta.ncd.gov](https://beta.ncd.gov/), uses the Federalist platform, a product of the General Services Administration. NCD chose the platform based on U.S. Web Design System standards for simplicity, accessibility and security.

Visitors are welcome to take a look and make recommendations to this early in-progress version of the site. NCD welcomes stakeholder input to improve all aspects of the user experience. The site feedback form is located at https://beta.ncd.gov/feedback or by sending an email to publiccomment@ncd.gov.

During the beta phase of development, NCD will continue regular updates to content, graphics, and site navigation. Over the next several months, NCD will be transitioning all content from the current site, still available for viewing at [NCD.gov](https://ncd.gov/). At the conclusion, the beta site will become NCD.gov.
