**WASHINGTON, DC --** The National Council on Disability (NCD) -- an independent federal agency that advises the President, Congress, and other federal agencies on the policies and programs that affect the lives of people with disabilities -- is honored to welcome Matan Aryeh Koch to its Board. On July 5, President Barack Obama announced his intention to nominate Litigation Associate Matan A. Koch to the National Council on Disability.

NCD's Chairman Jonathan Young hailed Koch's appointment by saying, "NCD's Board is now even stronger with the addition of Matan Koch. From his pro bono work for parents seeking guardianship of adult children with disabilities to helping prepare a brief for a mental health nonprofit to the New York State Court of Appeals, Matan's experience in both the legal and advocacy arenas bolsters the Council's charge of ensuring equal opportunity, full participation, independent living and economic self-sufficiency for all Americans with disabilities.  We look forward to his participation."

With the addition of Koch, the NCD Board now consists of: Jonathan Young, Gary Blumenthal, Chester Finn, Sara Gelser, Marylyn Howe, Janice Lehrer-Stein, Lonnie Moore, Ari Ne'eman, Dongwoo ("Joe") Pak, Clyde Terry, Dr. Fernando Torres-Gill, Linda Wetters and Pam Young-Holmes.
