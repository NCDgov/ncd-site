**WASHINGTON--**National Council on Disability Vice Chair and Acting Chair Shawn Kennemer sent a letter Wednesday to U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright regarding rulemaking impacting people with disabilities.

DOE's direct final rule, or DFR, certain new construction requirements related to disability nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs or activities.

As an independent federal agency advising the President, Congress and federal agencies on disability policy, NCD examined the rule and sent a letter to Wright. 

"NCD is deeply concerned with DOE’s intention to rescind 10 C.F.R. § 1040.73 of DOE’s Section 504 regulation as it contains longstanding, crucial requirements for physical accessibility of buildings constructed and altered using federal financial assistance," wrote Kennemer.

"NCD stands ready to assist DOE through our expertise and advisement to ensure that buildings constructed or altered with DOE’s financial assistance continue to be accessible to all Americans," wrote Kennemer. "We look forward to discussing this matter with you soon."  

NCD is an independent, bipartisan federal agency that advises Congress, the President, and other federal agencies on national disability policy.

DOE officials had requested public comment on the DFR, becoming effective July 15, unless significant adverse comments are received by June 16. Significant adverse comments are ones which oppose the rule and raise, alone or in combination, a serious enough issue related to each of the independent grounds for the rule that a substantive response is required.

Information on the DRF is available in the Federal Register and directs interested persons to submit comments using the Federal eRulemaking Portal at [www.regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOE-HQ-2025-0015-0001) under docket number DOE-HQ-2025-0015.

Kennemer

"Any plan to alter or rescind a regulation that is a cornerstone for accessibility to federally financed buildings, as here, should be considered only after meaningful consultation with disability experts and stakeholders and a meaningful opportunity for the public to be informed of the plan, understand its impacts, and have an opportunity to provide informed comments based on that information.
