**WASHINGTON, DC --** The National Council on Disability (NCD) -- an independent federal agency that advises the President, Congress, and other federal agencies on the policies and programs that affect the lives of people with disabilities -- is honored to welcome Stephanie Orlando to the agency.

We enthusiastically welcome Stephanie to the National Council on Disability."
