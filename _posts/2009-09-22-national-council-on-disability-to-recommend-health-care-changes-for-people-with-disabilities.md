**WASHINGTON—**The National Council on Disability (NCD) will release its latest report, The Current State of Health Care for People with Disabilities, on the NCD Website ([www.ncd.gov](http://www.ncd.gov/)) at 10:00 a.m. EDT on September 30, 2009.

The report focuses the nation's attention on the health care disparities experienced by people with disabilities, and provides information and recommendations that can help to eliminate health care inequities for people with disabilities.

This report provides a road map for eliminating the pervasive barriers to health care for people with disabilities, which will improve the quality of life, productivity, and well-being of greater numbers of Americans as the nation's population ages.
