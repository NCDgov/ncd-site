## **State’s use of Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) Based Cost-Effectiveness Reports to Inform Medicaid Coverage for Prescription Drugs**

**Background and Statement of Problem**

The QALY is a broad population-based cost and cost-effectiveness analyses developed by health economists to measure and compare the benefits of healthcare interventions for cost effectiveness which is used to allocate health care resources. The use QALYs in health-care coverage decisions, rather than metrics that consider specific patient needs and heterogeneity, have resulted in discrimination against people with chronic illnesses and disabilities because QALY-based metrics often conclude that the treatments they need are too expensive, resulting in delayed, restricted, and denied healthcare.

There are serious ethical concerns with how QALYs are developed and used. QALYs fall short in measuring health preferences for patients with chronic diseases and disabilities and place greater value on years lived in full health, or on interventions that prevent loss of perfect health while discounting gains in health for individuals with chronic illnesses. QALYS require valuing one individual’s life over another’s, which may result in only providing healthcare to those that are deemed to have the greatest benefit from a treatment, such as a person who will fully recover and return to perfect health. Additionally, people with disabilities may enjoy a comparable quality of life to non-disabled individuals but may face a shorter life expectancy compared to someone without their condition. Because QALYs are assigned by both quality as well as quantity of life, an incremental QALY assessment would prioritize providing treatment to a nondisabled person with a longer theoretical life expectancy over a person with a disability.

NCD’s recent report, *Quality Adjusted Life years and the Devaluation of Life with a Disability* described the history of QALY use by states, beginning with Oregon’s use of QALYs to determine what services would be covered by their Medicaid program. In 1992, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rejected the state of Oregon’s request to proceed with their prioritized list based on explicit cost-effectiveness ratios derived from QALYS because of its potential to discriminate against people with disabilities. The Secretary of the Oregon Department of Health and Human Services wrote an opinion to the New York Times stating, “Our principal concern is that Oregon's plan in substantial part values the life of a person with a disability less than the life of a person without a disability. This premise is discriminatory and inconsistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act.”

NCD’s report also found that New York has recently relied on QALY-based cost effectiveness reports by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) which led to a “stand-off” between the Medicaid agency and the drug manufacturer over the price the state would pay for a new a critical treatment, leaving patients waiting and using a less effective alternative. Despite the civil rights implications of using these reports, a 2020 Kaiser Foundation report, identified twenty-two states that used ICER and other cost effectiveness reports to value prescription drugs and treatments.  Several states have also shown interest in relying on international drug prices to inform Medicaid prescription drug coverage in their Medicaid programs.

**Report Purpose**

This purpose of this report is to follow up on NCD’s report, *Quality Adjusted Life years and the Devaluation of Life with a Disability*, with regard to State’s use of ICER’s QALY-based cost-effectiveness reports  or international drug prices to inform coverage of prescription drugs in their Medicaid programs.

It will describe how many States are using ICER QALY-based cost studies or referencing international prices; how this information is being used, e.g., as a benchmark or cost-threshold, and if this has resulted in restricted access to prescription drugs. The report will gather evidence that that shows whether reliance on this information is delaying access to or denial of coverage of necessary drugs and treatments for chronic illnesses. It will also describe methodological alternatives to QALYs that consider patient values and preferences. It will make findings and make specific recommendations to Congress, federal government, and states to address the findings.

**Research Questions**

Through the lens of section 504 and the ADA, the research will seek to answer:

1. How many states use ICER QALY-based cost studies or reference international drug prices set in reliance on the QALY to determine prescription drug prices for Medicaid? How much does it influence coverage of drugs and services in the Medicaid program? Negotiations with manufacturers?
2. Has patient’s access to prescription drugs resulted?  Describe the impact on access.
3. What are the most highly regarded alternatives to QALY-based cost studies that consider patient values and preferences? Do any measure cost-effectiveness? What is the impact of these alternatives on access to prescription drugs?
4. Has HHS accepted or rejected Medicaid plans from States that identify reliance on ICER reports or international drug prices to determine coverage of prescription drugs? If plans have been accepted, what states and what limitations are in these plans?

**Time Period**

Six months

**The deliverables for this project will include:**

A detailed preliminary framing paper.

A revised framing paper incorporating input from NCD Council members and staff.

A first draft report incorporating initial findings, conclusions, and recommendations that can be drawn from the examination.

A final report of no more than 80 pages (not including endnotes or appendices) incorporating input from NCD Council members and staff. Final reports must contain an executive summary with key findings and key recommendations; and specific sections on methodology; all findings; and all recommendations, organized according to the entity to which they are directed.

A brief “Report Highlights” document for each report that succinctly and in plain language encapsulates the report’s scope and purpose, major findings, and recommendations, and contains a link to the full report at the bottom. For an example of a Reports Highlights Page, refer to: *<https://ncd.gov/publications/2013/10242013>*.

**Requirements**

Pursuant to Executive Order 14005, NCD will only consider proposals from individuals or entities based in the United States.

Research must, in part, rely on data gathered from a newly established site that tracks State’s activity on use of ICER reports. NCD will provide further information on this specific resource after an award is made but use of this resource should be included as part of the research methodology in submitted proposals.

Any methodology used to obtain stakeholder input must allow for open-ended discussions between stakeholders, as opposed to soliciting answers to specific, predetermined questions. While the use of data from existing surveys is permitted, conducting surveys for purposes of this study is strongly discouraged. The inclusion of people with disabilities must be integral to the planning, development, and execution of this project.  The report should also reflect NCD’s view that the disability community is heterogeneous, with diverse needs and perspectives, and those perspectives should be included.

The awardee is responsible for reasonable accommodations at any meetings, events, forums, focus groups, etc. (i.e. sign language interpreters, CART reporters, and other such providers, as well as documents or other materials that are made available in public forums), associated with this agreement. If NCD hosts any events related to this project, it will be responsible for providing accommodations.

The awardee will present on the report before NCD at a quarterly Council meeting and must factor travel expenses into the proposed budget.

The report drafts must adhere to NCD’s editorial requirements which will be provided upon award of the cooperative agreement. Final drafts must be professionally edited before they are submitted to NCD.

**About the National Council on Disability**

Overview and Purpose

The National Council on Disability (NCD) is an independent federal agency comprised of a team of Presidential and Congressional appointees, an Executive Director appointed by the Chair, and a full-time professional staff. The purpose of NCD is to promote policies, programs, practices, and procedures that guarantee equal opportunity for all people with disabilities regardless of the nature or significance of the disability and to empower people with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of society.

Specific Duties

NCD’s statutory duties are set forth at 29 USC §781, and include:

(1) provide advice to the Director with respect to the policies and conduct of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research, including ways to improve research concerning individuals with disabilities and the methods of collecting and disseminating findings of such research;

(2) provide advice to the Commissioner with respect to the policies of and conduct of the Rehabilitation Services Administration;

(3) advise the President, the Congress, the Commissioner, the appropriate Assistant Secretary of the Department of Education, and the Director of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research on the development of the programs to be carried out under this chapter;

(4) provide advice regarding priorities for the activities of the Interagency Disability Coordinating Council and review the recommendations of such Council for legislative and administrative changes to ensure that such recommendations are consistent with the purposes of the Council to promote the full integration, independence, and productivity of individuals with disabilities;

(5) review and evaluate on a continuing basis—

(A) policies, programs, practices, and procedures concerning individuals with disabilities conducted or assisted by Federal departments and agencies, including programs established or assisted under this chapter or under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 \[42 U.S.C. 15001 et seq.]; and

(B) all statutes and regulations pertaining to Federal programs which assist such individuals with disabilities; in order to assess the effectiveness of such policies, programs, practices, procedures, statutes, and regulations in meeting the needs of individuals with disabilities;

(6) assess the extent to which such policies, programs, practices, and procedures facilitate or impede the promotion of the policies set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 780(a)(2) of this title;

(7) gather information about the implementation, effectiveness, and impact of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.);

(8) make recommendations to the President, the Congress, the Secretary, the Director of the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, and other officials of Federal agencies or other Federal entities, respecting ways to better promote the policies set forth in section 780(a)(2) of this title;

(9) provide to the Congress on a continuing basis advice, recommendations, legislative proposals, and any additional information that the National Council or the Congress deems appropriate; and

(10) review and evaluate on a continuing basis new and emerging disability policy issues affecting individuals with disabilities at the Federal, State, and local levels, and in the private sector, including the need for and coordination of adult services, access to personal assistance services, school reform efforts and the impact of such efforts on individuals with disabilities, access to health care, and policies that operate as disincentives for the individuals to seek and retain employment; and

Preparing and submitting to the President and Congress an annual report titled National Disability Policy: A Progress Report.

International

In 1995, NCD was designated by the Department of State to be the U.S. government’s official contact point for disability issues. Specifically, NCD interacts with the special rapporteur of the United Nations Commission for Social Development on disability matters.

Consumers Served and Current Activities

Although many government agencies deal with issues and programs affecting people with disabilities, NCD is the only federal agency charged with addressing, analyzing, and making recommendations on issues of public policy that affect people with disabilities regardless of age, disability type, perceived employment potential, economic need, specific functional ability, veteran status, or other individual circumstance. NCD recognizes its unique opportunity to facilitate independent living, community integration, and employment opportunities for people with disabilities by ensuring an informed and coordinated approach to addressing the concerns of people with disabilities and eliminating barriers to their active participation in community and family life.

NCD plays a major role in developing disability policy in America. NCD originally proposed what eventually became the ADA. To see NCD’s present and past work on issues that are key to the lives of people with disabilities, visit [www.ncd.gov](http://www.ncd.gov/).

Statutory History

NCD was established in 1978 as an advisory board within the Department of Health Education and Welfare (P.L. 95-602). The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1984 (P.L. 98-221) established NCD as an independent agency.
