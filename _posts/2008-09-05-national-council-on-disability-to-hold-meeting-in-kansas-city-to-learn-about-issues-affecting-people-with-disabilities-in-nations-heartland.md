**WASHINGTON—**The National Council on Disability (NCD) will conduct its next quarterly meeting at the Hyatt Regency Crown Center, 2345 McGee Street, Kansas City, Missouri, beginning at 8:30 a.m. C.D.T. on Monday, October 6 and ending at 11:00 a.m. C.D.T. on Wednesday, October 8, 2008. This meeting is open to the public.

In carrying out its mission, NCD believes it is vital to hear from communities around the country on what works and what does not for people with disabilities. The agenda will include sessions on emergency preparedness, healthcare, employment, and several other subjects of interest to the disability community.

Public comment sessions will be held Monday, October 6 from 9:00 a.m. until 9:30 a.m. C.D.T. and on Tuesday, October 7 from 4:30 p.m. until 5:00 p.m. C.D.T. A reception will be held at the hotel for meeting participants, audience members, and stakeholders from the disability community on Tuesday, October 7 immediately following the day's session.

NCD is an independent federal agency and is composed of 15 members appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. NCD provides advice to the President, Congress, and executive branch agencies to promote policies, programs, practices, and procedures that guarantee equal opportunity for all individuals with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of the disability; and empower individuals with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of society.
