**For Immediate Release**

Aug. 23, 2022

**WASHINGTON —** The National Council on Disability (NCD) – an independent federal agency – welcomes the appointment of Shawn Kennemer, of Bakersfield, California, to the Council.

Mr. Kennemer was appointed to NCD by House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy. He took the oath of office on Aug. 22 and began his term as an NCD council member at that time.

“In my 30-plus years of serving people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, it's an honor to serve,” said Council Member Kennemer. “I look forward to bringing my thoughts and experiences to the Council.”

He joins Chairman Andrés Gallegos, Vice Chairman Jim Brett, and Council Members David D'Arcangelo, Dr. Munr Kazmir, Dr. Rick Rader, Neil Romano, Daniel Schreck and Mary Vought.

Appointments to NCD are made by the President of the United States, the Senate Majority Leader, the Senate Minority Leader, the Speaker of the House, and the House Minority Leader pursuant to Section 451 of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (Pub. L. 113–128).

In welcoming him officially to the Council, Chairman Gallegos added the important work of those serving on the independent, nonpartisan Council:

"Our charge is not to serve the interests of those who appointed us,” said Chairman Gallegos. “Our charge is always to serve the interests of the over 61.4 million people with disabilities who depend upon us to address the critical needs affecting their lives; for disability knows no political, racial, ethnic, religious, or socio-economic lens.”

**About the National Council on Disability (NCD):** First established as a small advisory Council within the Department of Education in 1978, NCD became an independent federal agency in 1984. In 1986, NCD recommended enactment of an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and drafted the first version of the bill which was introduced in the House and Senate in 1988. Since the ADA became law in 1990, NCD has continued to play a leading role in crafting policy solutions, and in advising the President, Congress and other federal agencies on disability policies, programs, and practices.
