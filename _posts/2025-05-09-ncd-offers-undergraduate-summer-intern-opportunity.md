NCD is in search of an undergraduate summer intern who is interested in working alongside our small but mighty administration, finance, and operations team of three, full-time employees as we embark on a two-year, biennial financial audit of our agency in Washington, D.C. starting this month. 

The intern would assist in the audit preparations and other related administration and finance tasks as assigned. The supervisor of the intern has an accounting degree and decades of experience in the field. 

NCD is hoping for an intern to join in May through some or all of the summer. If you are interested in this opportunity, please send a statement of interest and your resume / CV to Netterie Lewis atÂ [nlewis@ncd.gov](mailto:nlewis@ncd.gov).
