### For Immediate Release

June 2, 2020

**WASHINGTON—**The National Council of Disability (NCD) joins government, civil rights, and civic organizations in calling for justice and greater accountability of police brutality, which has sadly become all too common in the U.S.

The recent, outrageous murder of George Floyd is but another horrific incident suffered by historically disenfranchised communities and highlights a growing and disturbing pattern of disregard for life itself. And it makes a mockery of our nation’s founding principles, of respecting every person’s life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.

The pain and suffering of marginalized people is real. However, violence is not the answer in our need to create change.

NCD recognizes these tragic events as part of a larger social pattern of inequality and marginalization impacting people because of race, disability, or both.

We all rely on law enforcement to ensure public safety, and the impacts of actions or inactions of law enforcement must be addressed. It is essential that law enforcement develop and cultivate cultural sensitivity and competence. In today’s interconnected world, any action that harms one community hurts us all.

NCD supports increased citizen oversight and accountability at the local level, increased data collection, and improved de-escalation training of police officers nationwide. NCD has also recommended the use and enforcement of consent decrees, as established under federal law, as a means of curtailing excessive force by law enforcement. Ultimately, all public servants are accountable to the public they serve.

NCD stands with those working for the common good and who share the goals of equal participation, protection, and due process for all.
