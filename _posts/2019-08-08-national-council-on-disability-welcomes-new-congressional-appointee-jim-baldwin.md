**WASHINGTON, D.C. —** The National Council on Disability (NCD) – an independent federal agency that advises the President, Congress and other federal agencies regarding disability policy matters – welcomes the appointment of Jim Baldwin, of Bakersfield, California, to the Council.

Baldwin’s appointment to NCD by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was published in the Congressional Record on July 19. 2019.

He joins Council Chairman Neil Romano, Vice Chairman Benro Ogunyipe, and members Billy Altom, Rabia Belt, Jim Brett, Andrés Gallegos, Wendy S. Harbour, and Clyde Terry.

Appointments to NCD are made by the President of the United States, the Senate Majority Leader, the Senate Minority Leader, the Speaker of the House, and the House Minority Leader pursuant to section 451 of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (Pub. L. 113–128).

He was appointed President of BARC in September 2001 after serving on BARC’s Board of Directors for more than eight years. He also serves as President and Current Director of the Kern County Board of Trade, and he is a Director on the Golden Empire Transit Board.

**About the National Council on Disability (NCD):** First established as a small advisory Council within the Department of Education in 1978, NCD became an independent federal agency in 1984. In 1986, NCD recommended enactment of an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and drafted the first version of the bill which was introduced in the House and Senate in 1988. Since the ADA became law in 1990, NCD has continued to play a leading role in crafting policy solutions, and in advising the President, Congress and other federal agencies on disability policies, programs, and practices.
