**Notice of Funding Opportunity**

**The Absence of People with Disabilities in Clinical Trials**



**Background**

\
People with disabilities are at a higher risk for numerous health conditions compared to the general population. For example, clinical trials for Alzheimer’s exclude people with Down syndrome, even though approximately 90% of people with Down syndrome will develop Alzheimer’s disease or dementia by age 55.[1](https://ncd.gov/newsroom/2023/notice-funding-opportunity-absence-people-disabilities-clinical-trials#_ftn1) Not only are people with disabilities (PWDs) at higher risk for many conditions and diseases compared to the general population, disability itself can change the presentation and/or management of a disease, and clinicians need to be aware of these differences.[2](https://ncd.gov/newsroom/2023/notice-funding-opportunity-absence-people-disabilities-clinical-trials#_ftn2)

The exclusion of PWDs in research has been well-documented.[3](https://ncd.gov/newsroom/2023/notice-funding-opportunity-absence-people-disabilities-clinical-trials#_ftn3) The exclusion of people with psychiatric, substance use, and intellectual disabilities is especially prevalent. Eligibility criteria affecting people with disabilities included exclusions for psychiatric (68 percent), substance use (62 percent), HIV or hepatitis (53 percent), cognitive or intellectual (42 percent), visual (34 percent), hearing (10 percent), mobility (9 percent), long-term care (6 percent), and speech and communication (3 percent) disability-related domains. Documented justification was provided for only 24 percent of these exclusions.[4](https://ncd.gov/newsroom/2023/notice-funding-opportunity-absence-people-disabilities-clinical-trials#_ftn4)

The discriminatory practices continue partly due to stigma and bias of PWDs and vague, generalized, and subjective exclusion criteria that is often copied and pasted from one study to another. Phrases such as:

- “In the investigator’s opinion, \[participants] are well-motivated, and capable.”;
- “Subject is generally frail, or has any (medical) condition that, in view of the investigator or the sponsor’s responsible medical officer, is likely to prohibit or limit further participation in the study…;
- “Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.”;
- “Is judged by the Investigator to be inappropriate for the study.”;
- “Any other reason the Investigator deems exclusionary.”

Given the pervasive stigma and bias of PWDs combined with a clinical trial investigators ability to exclude anyone from a research study, it should be no surprise that PWDs are not well represented in clinical trials. Some investigators have explicitly excluded people with intellectual disabilities by requiring subjects pass cognitive assessments or requiring that subjects know how to read and write.[5](https://ncd.gov/newsroom/2023/notice-funding-opportunity-absence-people-disabilities-clinical-trials#_ftn5) Few studies offered a reasonable accommodation so that PWDs could participate. (Plosky at 1426) This, despite the fact that Universal Design[6](https://ncd.gov/newsroom/2023/notice-funding-opportunity-absence-people-disabilities-clinical-trials#_ftn6) recommendations for medical research have been available for over a decade.[7](https://ncd.gov/newsroom/2023/notice-funding-opportunity-absence-people-disabilities-clinical-trials#_ftn7)

Researchers who receive federal funding also have a legal obligation not to discriminate against PWDs under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Whether the exclusion of PWDs in clinical trials is explicit or implicit, such exclusion is a possible violation of Sec. 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which states that “an individual shall not be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination on the grounds prohibited under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq. (race, color, national origin), Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. (sex), the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq. (age), or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794 (disability), under any health program or activity, any part of which is receiving federal financial assistance; any program or activity administered by the Department under Title I of the Act; or any program or activity administered by any entity established under such Title.”

**Report Purpose**

The purpose of this report is to address the explicit and implicit exclusion of people with disabilities in clinical trials, the repercussions of exclusion on the disability community, the legal requirements of clinical trial investigators to include PWDs in clinical trials and repercussions for not abiding by those requirements. The final report will provide recommendations and promising practices to increase the acceptance and participation rates of people with disabilities in clinical trials.

**Research Questions**

- How can clinical trial researchers, administrators and universities ensure meaningful participation of PWDs in clinical trials?
- What promising practices exist to combat conscious and unconscious bias which leads to the exclusion of PWDs in clinical trials?
- What changes need to be made to state regulations so regulations are not an obstacle to people with disabilities appropriately participating in clinical trials?
- What changes need to be made to federal regulations so regulations are not an obstacle to people with disabilities appropriately participating in clinical trials?
- What recommendations need to be made to federal agencies to ensure inclusion of PWDs in clinical trials?
- What is the value of having people with disabilities included in clinical trials?
- What are the consequences of not having people with disabilities included in clinical trials?

**Time Period**

6 months

NCD will notify the offeror by telephone and e-mail. This will begin negotiations for a cooperative agreement. The notification is not authorization to begin performance. Organizations or individuals whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible. A summary of the strengths and weaknesses identified by reviewers, of each declined proposal, not included identifying names or information about proposal reviewers, will be made available upon request.



**About the National Council on Disability**



**Overview and Purpose**

The National Council on Disability (NCD) is an independent federal agency comprised of a team of Presidential and Congressional appointees, an Executive Director appointed by the Chair, and a full-time professional staff. The purpose of NCD is to promote policies, programs, practices, and procedures that guarantee equal opportunity for all people with disabilities regardless of the nature or significance of the disability and to empower people with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of society.



**Specific Duties**

NCD’s statutory duties are set forth at 29 USC §781, and include:

(1) provide advice to the Director with respect to the policies and conduct of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research, including ways to improve research concerning individuals with disabilities and the methods of collecting and disseminating findings of such research;

(2) provide advice to the Commissioner with respect to the policies of and conduct of the Rehabilitation Services Administration;

(3) advise the President, the Congress, the Commissioner, the appropriate Assistant Secretary of the Department of Education, and the Director of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research on the development of the programs to be carried out under this chapter;

(4) provide advice regarding priorities for the activities of the Interagency Disability Coordinating Council and review the recommendations of such Council for legislative and administrative changes to ensure that such recommendations are consistent with the purposes of the Council to promote the full integration, independence, and productivity of individuals with disabilities;

(5) review and evaluate on a continuing basis—

(A) policies, programs, practices, and procedures concerning individuals with disabilities conducted or assisted by Federal departments and agencies, including programs established or assisted under this chapter or under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 \[42 U.S.C. 15001 et seq.]; and

(B) all statutes and regulations pertaining to Federal programs which assist such individuals with disabilities; in order to assess the effectiveness of such policies, programs, practices, procedures, statutes, and regulations in meeting the needs of individuals with disabilities;

(6) assess the extent to which such policies, programs, practices, and procedures facilitate or impede the promotion of the policies set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 780(a)(2) of this title;

(7) gather information about the implementation, effectiveness, and impact of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.);

(8) make recommendations to the President, the Congress, the Secretary, the Director of the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, and other officials of Federal agencies or other Federal entities, respecting ways to better promote the policies set forth in section 780(a)(2) of this title;

(9) provide to the Congress on a continuing basis advice, recommendations, legislative proposals, and any additional information that the National Council or the Congress deems appropriate; and

(10) review and evaluate on a continuing basis new and emerging disability policy issues affecting individuals with disabilities at the Federal, State, and local levels, and in the private sector, including the need for and coordination of adult services Access to personal assistance services, school reform efforts and the impact of such efforts on individuals with disabilities, access to health care, and policies that operate as disincentives for the individuals to seek and retain employment; and

Preparing and submitting to the President and Congress an annual report titled National Disability Policy: A Progress Report.

**International**

In 1995, NCD was designated by the Department of State to be the U.S. government’s official contact point for disability issues. Specifically, NCD interacts with the special rapporteur of the United Nations Commission for Social Development on disability matters.

**Consumers Served and Current Activities**

Although many government agencies deal with issues and programs affecting people with disabilities, NCD is the only federal agency charged with addressing, analyzing, and making recommendations on issues of public policy that affect people with disabilities regardless of age, disability type, perceived employment potential, economic need, specific functional ability, veteran status, or other individual circumstance. NCD recognizes its unique opportunity to facilitate independent living, community integration, and employment opportunities for people with disabilities by ensuring an informed and coordinated approach to addressing the concerns of people with disabilities and eliminating barriers to their active participation in community and family life.

NCD plays a major role in developing disability policy in America. NCD originally proposed what eventually became the ADA. To see NCD’s present and past work on issues that are key to the lives of people with disabilities, visit [www.ncd.gov](http://www.ncd.gov/).

**Statutory History**

NCD was established in 1978 as an advisory board within the Department of Health Education and Welfare (P.L.95-602). The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1984 (P.L. 98-221) established NCD as an independent agency.
