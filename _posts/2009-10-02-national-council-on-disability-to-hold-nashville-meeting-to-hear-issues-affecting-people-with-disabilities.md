**WASHINGTON—**The National Council on Disability (NCD) will conduct its next quarterly meeting at the Holiday Inn Express, 920 Broadway, Nashville, TN, beginning at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, October 26, 2009, and ending at 11:00 a.m. on Wednesday, October 28, 2009. This meeting is open to the public.

NCD believes it is vital to hear from communities around the country on what works and what does not for people with disabilities. This meeting will provide another opportunity for that exchange in the Volunteer State. The agenda will include sessions on issues affecting Tennesseans with disabilities and their families, such as cuts to funding for federal and state services, emergency preparedness, healthcare, housing, assistive technology, and restraints and seclusion.

Specific times are also designated to receive public comment, supported by a toll-free call-in line, and input is encouraged and greatly appreciated. Individuals or organizations can also provide written comments by e-mail, fax, or mail. A public comment session will be held Monday, October 26, from 4:30 p.m. until 5 p.m. CST. The toll-free call-in number is (888) 790-6568, and the pass code is "NCD Meeting."

NCD will also host a reception at the hotel for meeting participants, audience members, and stakeholders from the disability community on Tuesday, October 27 from noon until 2:00 p.m. Additional details about the meeting will be posted on the NCD Web site as soon as they become available. You will also find the meeting agenda posted there approximately 10 days before the meeting is scheduled, and written comments for Council consideration can be submitted at any time by writing to [ncd@ncd.gov](mailto:ncd@ncd.gov).

The purpose of NCD, an independent federal agency, is to promote programs, practices, policies and procedures that ensure full inclusion of people with disabilities into all aspects of society. NCD accomplishes this mission by providing advice and making recommendations to the President, Congress, governmental agencies, and other stakeholders.
