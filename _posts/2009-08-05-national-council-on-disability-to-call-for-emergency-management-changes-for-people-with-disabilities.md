**WASHINGTON—**The National Council on Disability (NCD) will release its latest report on effective emergency management for people with disabilities at 9:45 a.m. on August 12 at the International Association of Emergency Managers' 2009 National Conference on Community Preparedness—The Power of Citizen Corps at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City Hotel, 2799 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA. NCD Vice Chairperson Pat Pound will discuss the report's findings and recommendations during a breakout session.

In this report, NCD offers information and advice to assist all levels of government in its work to establish evidence-based policies, programs and practices across the lifecycle of disasters. This report provides examples of effective community efforts with respect to people with disabilities, and evaluates many emergency preparedness, disaster relief, and homeland security program efforts deployed by both public and private sectors.

Additional information about people with disabilities and emergency management can be found at NCD's Lessons Learned page and in NCD's 2005 report, Saving Lives: Including People with Disabilities in Emergency Planning.
