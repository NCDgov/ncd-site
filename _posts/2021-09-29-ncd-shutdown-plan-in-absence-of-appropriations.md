**1. PURPOSE:** To provide the National Council on Disability’s (“NCD”) policy guidance and instructions for actions to be taken when Congress fails to enact either regular appropriations, a continuing resolution, or needed supplemental, resulting in an interruption of fund availability. In the absence of appropriations:

* NCD officers may not incur any obligations that cannot lawfully be funded from prior appropriations unless such obligations are otherwise authorized by law.
* NCD officers may incur obligations as necessary for orderly termination of an agency's functions, but funds may not be disbursed

**2. SCOPE:** This plan applies to all NCD personnel including the nine Special Government Employees (private citizen Presidential and Congressional appointees.)

**3. POLICY:** In order to execute an orderly shutdown, the following information is provided:

* Estimated time to complete shutdown: One half-day;
* Number of on-board employees prior to execution: 11;
* Number of employees retained under plan: 0;
* Executive Director, on behalf of the Chair, will notify OMB that shutdown procedures have initiated;
* Director of Administration, Finance and Operations or designee will notify building management of shutdown status;
* Director of Administration, Finance and Operations will notify all agency personnel of shutdown status and will initiate action to issue furlough notices and other instructions as appropriate;
* Director of Administration, Finance and Operations will direct Contracting Officer's Representatives to notify agency contractors of shutdown status and other instructions as appropriate;
* Director of Administration, Finance and Operations will direct Network Consultant to ensure servers and other IT equipment are secured; and
* Agency personnel will be instructed to obtain information from news outlets for when a continuing resolution or an FY 2022 appropriation has been approved and that they will be expected to return to work on their next regularly scheduled workday.
