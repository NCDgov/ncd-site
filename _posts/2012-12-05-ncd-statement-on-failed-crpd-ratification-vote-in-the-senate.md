**WASHINGTON, DC –** The Chairman of the National Council on Disability (NCD), an independent federal agency, expressed his deep disappointment that the United States Senate fell short of the votes needed to pass the resolution for ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).

“Yesterday, the United States had an opportunity to join more than 120 countries in a unified commitment to protect the rights of people with disabilities around the globe. It is deeply disappointing the Senate chose not to do so at this time. The CRPD was conceived with the same goals as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): to empower individuals with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of society,” said Jonathan Young, NCD Chairman. “Through the development phase of the treaty and our support throughout the process, NCD has proudly encouraged the adoption of the same protections Americans with disabilities enjoy because of the ADA to other nations worldwide.

Almost one decade ago, the National Council on Disability kicked off U.S. disability community consideration of an international treaty by publishing a White Paper titled [*"*Understanding the Role of an International Convention on the Human Rights of People with Disabilities."](https://www.ncd.gov/rawmedia_repository/fab40111_e273_4616_b451_d7c642b3b42b.pdf) Since that time, NCD has published numerous documents and reports in support of the development, signature and ratification of the CRPD.

“It is devastating that the Senate did not take this leap forward with the same bipartisan effort the community had with the ADA in advancing the quality of life for people with disabilities in the U.S. and worldwide, but NCD will continue to recommend ratification of this historic treaty to the 113th Congress,” added Joan Durocher, NCD's General Counsel and Director of Policy.

**About the National Council on Disability:** NCD is an independent federal agency of 15 Presidentially-appointed Council Members and full-time professional staff, who advise the President, Congress and other federal agencies on disability policy, programs, and practices.
