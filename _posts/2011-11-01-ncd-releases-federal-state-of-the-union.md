### New Report Offers Solutions for Improving Equality and Increasing Savings

N﻿ov. 1, 2011

**WASHINGTON, DC** — On Tuesday, November 1, the National Council on Disability (NCD) will release National Disability Policy: A Progress Report detailing Federal disability policy. NCD is a small, independent federal agency comprised of 15 Presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed Council Members and a small staff, who advise the President, Congress and other Federal agencies on disability policy, programs and services.

In the report, NCD assesses Federal disability policy in the United States and examines how emerging trends and government policies influence the quality of life of Americans with disabilities. NCD also offers recommendations to maximize independence and self-sufficiency of people with disabilities. The report notes progress where it has occurred and makes recommendations to both the Executive and Legislative branches where necessary.

"People with disabilities have lower rates of employment, lower annual earnings, lower educational attainment and achievement; lack adequate access to housing, transportation, technology, and health care," revealed Jonathan Young, NCD Chairman.  "The current economic downturn is having a disproportionate negative on the quality of life for people with disabilities and their families. A strong Federal commitment to the implementation and enforcement of the standard set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act will be central in determining both success and savings in these difficult economic times. This report provides a necessary snapshot of where we're at – and a clear, workable suggestions for moving forward."

"People don't live in silos.  Living, learning and earning in America requires the integration of various complimentary supports and approaches. Policy decisions, if we want them to work, must reflect that reality," continued Aaron Bishop, NCD's Executive Director. "Over the past year, NCD brought people together in a multitude of ways to exchange information, build collaborations, and inform solutions to both long-standing and emerging challenges.  By connecting community with the most recent national data available we've helped identify unique solutions to correct the vast disparities that still exist between people with and without disabilities in the United States."
