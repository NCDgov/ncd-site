**WASHINGTON—**The National Council on Disability (NCD) today invited the Atlanta disability community to participate in NCD's Atlanta quarterly board meeting. The meeting will take place at the Crowne Plaza Atlanta Buckhead, 3377 Peachtree Road NE, Atlanta, Georgia on Monday, April 16 from 10:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. and Tuesday, April 17, 2007, from 9:00 a.m. until 400 p.m. These events are free of charge and open to the public.

Public comment sessions will take place on April 16, 2007, at 10:00 a.m. and 4:15 p.m., and on April 17, 2007, at 9:00 a.m.

According to NCD chairperson John R. Vaughn, "We believe it is vital that NCD hears from disability communities around the country on what works and what does not for people with disabilities. We are delighted to have the opportunity to visit Atlanta and learn first hand about the experiences of people with disabilities from Georgia. Please save the date and do not miss this opportunity to meet NCD board members and staff and offer your comments during the public comment sessions."

"We also are having a special reception at the hotel for the disability community on Monday evening from 5:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. This reception will provide another great opportunity for us to meet the Atlanta disability community and hear their thoughts on the future," Vaughn concluded.
