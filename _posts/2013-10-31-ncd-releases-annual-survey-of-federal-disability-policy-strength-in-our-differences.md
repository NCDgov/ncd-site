**WASHINGTON, DC** —The National Council on Disability (NCD) – an independent federal agency that recommends disability policy to the President, Congress and other federal agencies – today releases its yearly report on the nation’s progress in achieving equality of opportunity, independent living, full participation and economic self-sufficiency for an estimated 57 million Americans with disabilities.

In keeping with the maxim “Nothing About Us Without Us” widely adopted by U.S. disability advocates two decades ago, NCD consulted with the broad disability community in determining its findings, and the expertise of advocates, stakeholders and service providers provided the foundation for NCD's policy recommendations. NCD offers this status check of disability policy in federally funded programs in the United States and abroad through a combination of insights gleaned by the experiences of individuals with disabilities interviewed for this report, combined with analysis of data indicators where available. 

“NCD's 2013 Report on National Disability Policy: Strength in Our Differences returned to its traditional roots by seeking input from the broad and diverse disability community to survey what progress has been made and what obstacles continue to be encountered in achieving full integration and participation in all aspects of American life,” said NCD Councilmember Janice Lehrer-Stein. “As we approach the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), NCD's report is intended to support continued progress toward achieving the goals of full equality, liberty and opportunity for Americans with disabilities. As always, the Council remains ready to work with the Administration, Congress and all Americans as we progress toward realizing the promise and potential of the ADA.” 

NCD's report highlights federal achievements from August 2012 to September 2013 and identifies areas where changes in public policy and additional steps are needed.  

Full report along with a comprehensive executive summary and overview of highlights is available on NCD's website at[/progress_reports/10312013](https://www.ncd.gov/progress_reports/10312013).
