**For Immediate Release**

January 8, 2026

**WASHINGTON–**The National Council on Disability (NCD) invites the public to present public comment during the Council's next quarterly meeting January 22 in Orlando, Florida.

For the January 22 Council meeting, NCD will have two public comment periods of 25 minutes each. The first on youth institutionalized in nursing homes, and the second on experiences of disabled Floridians in recent natural disasters in Florida.  Additional information on specifics of the topic is available on NCD’s public comment page at [https://ncd.gov/public-comment](https://www.ncd.gov/public-comment/).

This meeting will take place at the Rosen Shingle Creek Orlando, 9939 Universal Blvd., Orlando, Florida 32819. The event will also be streamed live via Zoom for Government for those not able to attend in person.

The Council will receive comments in-person and over Zoom, and will share comments submitted via email during the meeting. 

Due to the hybrid nature of the event, in-person presentations will be given priority. While preference is to receive input from Florida residents, those with comments on the topic may still participate.

To provide public comment during the Meeting, NCD requests advanced registration by sending an email to PublicComment@ncd.gov with the subject line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and topic of comment included in the body of your email.

Deadline for registration is January 20, 8 p.m. EST. Please indicate if you are providing the comment in-person, over Zoom or only submitting via email. All individuals desiring to make public comment are strongly encouraged to read NCD’s guidelines for public comment in advance of the meeting at: [https://ncd.gov/public-comment](https://www.ncd.gov/public-comment/).

To provide written comments by email, please send personal experiences, and/or articles, data, and other research on the following topics to PublicComment@ncd.gov. Your contributions will help strengthen our investigations and provide for a more comprehensive view for federal policymakers.

While public comment can be submitted on any topic over email, comments during the meeting should be specific to the topics listed.

In-person attendees can also sign up for public comment at the venue.

The Council meeting is a public event. Full information on the event can be found on our [upcoming meeting page](https://www.ncd.gov/meeting/2026-01-22-jan-22-23-2026-council-meeting/).
