**WASHINGTON--**The National Council on Disability (NCD) announces the update of a toolkit the Council first developed in 2003.

[Understanding Disabilities: In American Indian & Alaska Native Communities](https://ncd.gov/publications/2023/understanding-disabilities-american-indian-alaska-native-communities-toolkit-guide) has been refreshed with updated information about disabilities, tribes and resources to increase awareness and knowledge of the needs of Native elders living with disabilities. NCD collaborated with the National Indian Council on Aging (NICOA), who undertook updating the toolkit. 

"In an effort to update the Toolkit Guide with NICOA, a huge 'talking circle' was created through input and collaboration  across Indian Country," said NCD Council Member Hoskie Benally, Jr. "This updated disability guide was completed through personal interviews with persons with a disability, collaboration with American Indian disability organizations, and through research and collaboration with experts," he said. "It opens a vast source for becoming knowledgeable of services and resources for persons with a disability, their family members, and service providers in addressing the issues and needs being faced by American Indians with disabilities, providing a spirit of hope across Indian Country." 

This resource is divided into dedicated sections for healthy living, education, independent living, vocational rehabilitation and employment resources, assistive technology, housing and facilities, and transportation. Additional information provides overviews on federal disabilities laws, initiatives, agencies, and organizations that support work with Native individuals with disabilities and communities.
