**Washington, DC---**The National Council on Disability (NCD) will release two reports on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) at a news conference during its summer quarterly board meeting, which will take place July 24-26 at the Crowne Plaza Chicago Metro, 733 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. The news conference will take place on Thursday, July 26 at 9:30 a.m.

*The Impact of the Americans with Disabilities Act: Assessing the Progress Toward Achieving the Goals of the ADA* report describes a two-year retrospective study and review of the impact the ADA has had on the lives of Americans with disabilities over the past sixteen years, with particular focus on the four major goals of the ADA-equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency.

*Implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act: Challenges, Best Practices, and New Opportunities for Success*reflects the experiences and ideas of ADA stakeholders from around the country, including small and large businesses, employers, judges and legal professionals, governmental entities, and individuals with disabilities, concerning ADA implementation. Through this extensive stakeholder input, NCD learned of the many strategies for ADA implementation that have been successful, as well as obstacles that are preventing ADA implementation.

Also during the Chicago quarterly meeting, NCD will conduct a panel discussion on emergency preparedness on July 24 at 1:15 p.m. and a panel discussion on livable communities/best practices for mental health on July 25 at 9:30 a.m.

These meetings are open to the public. People with disabilities are encouraged to attend and participate in the daily public comment segments of the meeting.

NCD is an independent federal agency and is composed of 15 members appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. It provides advice to the President, Congress, and executive branch agencies to promote policies, programs, practices, and procedures that guarantee equal opportunity for all individuals with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of the disability and to empower individuals with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of society.
