**WASHINGTON, DC** — On Tuesday, September 18, the National Council on Disability (NCD) released its annual progress report on national disability policy. In the report, NCD assesses the state of federal disability policy in the last year and examines how emerging trends and government policies influence the quality of life of Americans with disabilities. The report notes progress where it has occurred and makes recommendations to both the executive and legislative branches where necessary.

“In the current era of fiscal restraint, our nation’s long-term fiscal stability depends, in part, on creating meaningful opportunities for Americans with disabilities to contribute to our nation’s collective well-being and eliminating policies that trap people with disabilities in cycles of poverty and dependence,” said NCD Chairman Jonathan Young. “Effective coordination and collaboration of supports and services that meet individual needs has never been more essential. As the Administration and Congress prepare to tackle obstacles that have stymied greater achievement of the goals outlined by the Americans with Disabilities Act, NCD stands ready to assist all branches of government in making the most of the progress our nation has made to date – and increase access and opportunity for our nation going forward. Failure to do so not only jeopardizes the lives of people with disabilities; it also threatens our national recovery.”

NCD’s 2012 report covers the period between summer 2011 through spring 2012 organized under the broader policy areas of living, learning and earning and reviews top-level policy developments and their effects on the lives of Americans with disabilities, including notable federal actions and state trends.
