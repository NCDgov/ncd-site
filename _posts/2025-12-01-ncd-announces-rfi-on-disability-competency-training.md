**WASHINGTON--**The National Council on Disability (NCD) is requesting information to help inform an upcoming policy brief.

The request for information (RFI) concerns the need for disability clinical care and competency training of medical professionals. 

With respect to the status of disability clinical care and competency training within the U.S., NCD invites comments based on the following questions. Please explain your answers and provide references and data, if possible:

1. What are the challenges and obstacles for schools within the US to adopt and incorporate an appropriate disability clinical care curriculum over the course of their students' training?
2. What is the connection between clinical confidence and changes in behavior and attitudes among healthcare providers?
3. What are the transferable skills that clinicians can learn from “disability competency training” to apply to all other patient populations (for instance people who are elderly, those with complex and chronic co-existing conditions, etc.)?
4. What are the existing curriculum resources that can be adopted and incorporated into current provider training?
5. What are examples of existing curriculum or standards of learning inclusive of disability clinical care/competency training that could be consulted for development of new required standards of learning across medical schools; and/or adopted wholesale as part of a program's education of medical professionals?

The information provided will be kept confidential and will not be attributed to specific individuals or organizations.

Electronic comments and information must be submitted by 11:59 EST on January 6, 2026 via email to NCD Senior Attorney Advisor Amged Soliman at asoliman@ncd.gov.
