**WASHINGTON—**Marylyn Howe, a resident of Marshfield Hills, Massachusetts, was reappointed by President George W. Bush to serve as a member of the National Council on Disability (NCD) ([www.ncd.gov](https://ncd.gov/ "/")). The U.S. Senate reconfirmed Ms. Howe's nomination on October 2, 2008.

Ms. Howe currently is the director of public policy at the Massachusetts Developmental Disabilities Council. She formerly was the executive director of the Massachusetts Assistive Technology Partnership at Children's Hospital in Boston, where she advocated strongly for people with disabilities to become empowered and independent through technology.

NCD is an independent federal agency and is composed of 15 members appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. It provides advice to the President, Congress, and executive branch agencies to promote policies, programs, practices, and procedures that guarantee equal opportunity for all individuals with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of the disability and to empower individuals with disabilities to achieve economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and inclusion and integration into all aspects of society.
