**WASHINGTON—**The [National Council on Disability](https://ncd.gov/ "blocked::/") (NCD) is proud to introduce eight new Board Members who were nominated by President Barack Obama on December 17, 2009, confirmed by the U.S. Senate, and duly appointed as Members. President Obama has further designated Jonathan Young as Chairman. The new Members are: Jonathan Young (Chairman), Gary Blumenthal, Chester Finn, Sara Gelser, Ari Ne'eman, Dongwoo Joseph "Joe" Pak, Carol Jean Reynolds, and Fernando M. Torres-Gil. Individual biographies for each new Council Member are located at the end of this release.

"I am honored to serve as Chairman of the National Council on Disability and pleased to be joined by an outstanding group of Council Members," stated NCD's new Chairman Jonathan Young. "I also want to thank former Chairperson Linda Wetters and NCD Executive Director Joan Durocher for working tirelessly to ensure a smooth transition."

NCD is an independent federal agency charged with advising the President, Congress, and other federal officials and entities on all policies, programs, practices and procedures affecting people with disabilities. NCD's mission is to further the goals enshrined in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990: equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living and economic self-sufficiency for all people with disabilities.

"July 26 marks the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. It is an occasion not only to celebrate our achievements, but also to redouble our efforts to realize the policy goals of the ADA. Meaningful progress won't come easily, but that is a challenge I embrace as Chairman," said Chairman Young.

NCD will commemorate the ADA anniversary with a Disability Policy Summit, taking place July 25-28 in Washington, D.C. The theme for the Summit is Living, Learning, & Earning. "This cross-cutting theme is designed to focus on real-life objectives shared by all Americans, including Americans with disabilities, and to concentrate our efforts on working across rather than within entrenched policy silos," said Chairman Young.

The newest Members of the Council join five other Members previously appointed by former President George W. Bush: Victoria Ray Carlson, Marylyn Howe, Heather McCallum, Lonnie Moore, and Linda Wetters. There are currently two vacancies on the Council.

NCD also extends its gratitude to several outgoing Board Members for their public service: Robert Davila, Graham Hill, Kathy Martinez, Lisa Mattheiss, Katherine McCary, Pat Pound, Anne Rader, and Tony Williams.

"NCD has a proud legacy, which includes calling for the enactment of the ADA and later offering the first draft in 1988," said Chairman Young. "NCD Members and staff, past and present, have been tireless public servants, working to enact and improve public policies that give people with disabilities a chance to risk, succeed, and fail like everyone else. I am grateful for the Council's past work, and look forward to working closely with my fellow Council Members, staff, and NCD's many stakeholders to further our collective mission in the years ahead."

The full Board now consists of: Jonathan Young, Ph.D., Gary Blumenthal, Victoria Ray Carlson, Chester Finn, Sara Gelser, Marylyn Howe, Heather McCallum, Lonnie Moore, Ari Ne'eman, Joe Pak, Carol Reynolds, Dr. Fernando Torres-Gill, Linda Wetters, and there are two vacancies.
