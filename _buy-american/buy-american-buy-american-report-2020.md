Dear Ms. Drake,

The National Council on Disability (NCD) is pleased to submit the required report to comply with Executive Order 14005. NCD designates Lisa Grubb, Director of Finance and Administration as the senior accountable official. Ms. Grubb may be contacted at: 202-272-2113 or lgrubb@ncd.gov

NCD is an independent federal agency charged with advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies regarding policies, programs, practices, and procedures that affect people with disabilities. NCD’s statutory authority is purely advisory in nature, and as such, NCD does not have community outreach programs and does not aid, assist, or offer benefits or services to the public. NCD’s cooperative agreements are for services and NCD does not procure any goods, products, or materials in our cooperative agreements. As an agency focused on providing advice on U.S. policy, the terms and conditions of our cooperative agreements will require that the contractor be based in the United States. We have not issued any waivers to this policy in the terms and conditions of our cooperative agreements.

Furthermore, NCD complies with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, 41 U.S.C. 401, et seq, and ensures compliance with procurement regulations, and monitors changes of the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR), and GSA Chief Acquisition Officer for contracting, competitive outsourcing, and computer equipment. NCD made no purchases of any articles, materials, or supplies manufactured outside the United States within the meaning of the Buy American Act. No waivers were necessary nor granted with respect to such articles, materials, or supplies under the Buy American Act.

Sincerely,

Anne Sommers McIntosh

Executive Director
