Dear Ms. Drake:

The National Council on Disability (NCD) is pleased to submit its fiscal year 2023 report for Items Manufactured within the United States vs. outside the United States according to the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a - 10d) and Executive Order 10582. As prescribed by the Act, the appropriate information has been collected.

The National Council on Disability made no purchases of any articles, materials, or supplies manufactured outside the United States within the meaning of the Buy American Act. No waivers were necessary nor granted with respect to such articles, materials, or supplies under the Buy American Act.

NCD spent $10,618 for goods manufactured in the United States, and $0 for goods manufactured outside the United States in accordance with Buy American Act exemptions. Information Technology items are exempt from the Buy American Act and the funding NCD spent on those items has not been included.

This information is available to the public on NCD's website (www.ncd.gov).If you have any questions concerning this report, please contact Lisa Grubb, Director of Administration, Finance and Operations, at 202-272-2113, or by e-mail at lgrubb@ncd.gov

Sincerely,

Anne Sommers McIntosh
