CERTIFICATION of CLOSED MEETING

I hereby certify, as NCD’s General Counsel, in my opinion the meeting of the National Council on Disability on February 8th, 2024 at 5:10 p.m. ET may be closed to the public pursuant to 5 USC 552b (c)(2) of the Government in Sunshine Act (information relating solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency).
A copy of this certification, together with a statement from the NCD Chairman setting forth the time and place of the meeting, and the persons present, shall be retained by the agency. The agency shall maintain a complete transcript or electronic recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, except that in the case of a meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public pursuant to specified exceptions within the Act, the agency shall maintain either such a transcript or recording, or a set of minutes.

General Counsel
