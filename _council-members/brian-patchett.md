Brian Patchett is president & CEO of Louisiana Association for the Blind. He has been a leader in the field of health and social services for over 25 years, building organizations that deliver employment and rehabilitation services for people with visual and other disabilities and worked closely with leaders at the national level to strengthen service organizations in the U.S. and around the world.

He has had a visual impairment since age 7 and he has been a self-advocate and for other people with disabilities throughout his life.

During his undergraduate time at Utah State University, he worked with the University Affiliate Program on Disability, advising people across the state on Assistive Technology and The Americans with Disability Act. I received my Master of Public Administration from the Maxwell School at Syracuse University as well as a Masters in Rehabilitation Counseling. I counseled students with disabilities to help them be successful in college and in their future endeavors. I spent 3.5 years studying the Russian language in college, and two summers in Russia on an exchange talking about disability related issues.

I was influential in passing legislation to improve independence for people with disabilities. The results were improved access to early intervention services, independent living skills, and making voting accessible.
