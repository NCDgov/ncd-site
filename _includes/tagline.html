              NCD has a proud history. In 1986, NCD recommended enactment of an
              Americans with Disabilities Act, and then drafted the first
              version of the bill introduced in the House and Senate in 1988.
              Since enactment of the ADA in 1990, NCD has continued to play a
              leading role in addressing the concerns of people with
              disabilities by advising public policy.
