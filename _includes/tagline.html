            NCD has a proud history. In 1986, NCD recommended enactment of an
            Americans with Disabilities Act, and then drafted the first version
            of the bill introduced in the House and Senate in 1988. Since enactment
            of the ADA in 1990, NCD has continued to play a leading role in
            addressing the concerns of people with disabilities by advising
            public policy.
