**PUBLIC COMMENT:** Your participation during the public comment period provides an opportunity for us to hear from you -- individuals, businesses, providers, educators, parents and advocates. Your comments are important in bringing to the Council’s attention and issues and priorities of the disability community.

For the May 29 Council meeting, NCD will have a public comment period of 45 minutes and requests comments from the public regarding the experiences of youth and younger adults in nursing homes and for our 2025 Progress Report focused on what the public considers the most notable disability policy developments since Summer 2024. Additional information on specifics of the topic is available on NCD’s public comment page at <https://ncd.gov/public-comment>.

**The Council will receive in-person comments only at the meeting**.

To provide in-person public comment during the NCD Council Meeting, NCD requests advanced registration by sending an email to PublicComment@ncd.gov with the subject line “Public Comment” and your name, organization, state, and topic of comment included in the body of your email. Those who do not pre-register will be given the opportunity to sign up to give comment in-person after pre-registrants are called on. 

Deadline for advance registration is May 27, 8:00 p.m. EDT. All individuals desiring to make public comment are strongly encouraged to read NCD’s guidelines for public comment in advance of the meeting at: <https://ncd.gov/public-comment>.

While public comment can be submitted on any topic over email, comments during the meeting should be specific to experiences with youth and younger adults with disabilities in nursing homes and the most notable disability policy developments since Summer 2024 – both topics feeding into open projects NCD is currently researching.
