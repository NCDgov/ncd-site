**Sï»¿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

The National Council on Disability's _Understanding Disabilities in American Indian and Alaska Native Communities: Toolkit Guide_ was developed through the passionate collaboration of many individuals. The foundation of this project was formed in a powerful sharing of experiences, knowledge, and hopes among consumers and advocates who live with disabilities. These individuals strived to create a new perspective about what it means to be an American Indian or an Alaska Native with a disability. This new consciousness will serve to transform Indian communities nationally and offer a new hope to so many individuals who for so long have felt invisible with no voice.
