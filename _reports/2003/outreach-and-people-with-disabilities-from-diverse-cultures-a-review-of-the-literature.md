**S﻿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

As a part of its Cultural Diversity Initiative (CDI), NCD sought to answer fundamental questions about outreach: What is it? What are current outreach definitions, themes, models, and challenges? What is the state of disability/diversity outreach at the national level by the federal government? This review of literature was one of three projects of the NCD CDI, along with an outreach forum held in July 2003, designed to inform the development of the third component - an outreach toolkit for use by federal agencies to enhance their outreach efforts.
