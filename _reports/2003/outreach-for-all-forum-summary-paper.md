S﻿COPE AND PURPOSE:

On July 28, 2003, the NCD hosted a working meeting in Washington, DC, that brought youth and adults from multiple cultures across the country together with senior officials from nine federal agencies and one White House initiative. Sixty people spent a full day in work sessions that focused on finding ways to create a two-way street for people with disabilities who come from diverse communities and government agencies that have a responsibility for providing appropriate services and for supporting empowerment and movement toward full participation in society.
