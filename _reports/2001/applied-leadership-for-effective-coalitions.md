**S﻿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

This guide is designed to assist readers who are interested in promoting leadership development and coalition building. The need for this guide, with resources, grew out of a National Council on Disability-sponsored meeting among people from diverse cultures in May 2000. Whether the reader's purpose is to obtain information on the design or redesign of leadership development and coalition building efforts for use with people from diverse cultural groups or with a broader population, the premises in this guide may prove to be invaluable tools for promoting a more inclusive society.
