**SCOPE AND PURPOSE:** The collective effort of the federal government in coordination with states and U.S. Territories are essential in advancing policy that supports Congress’s goals in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. These partnerships are essential in promoting equality of opportunity, economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and full participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of society regardless of type or severity of disability.

This year, NCD highlights key policy developments along with the ongoing policy barriers and their impact on people with disabilities throughout 2025. Rather than NCD’s normal deep-dive investigations into a single topic, the progress report serves as a quick pulse check and briefing document, succinctly noting developments in several key policy areas, providing historical NCD advisement on each issue where applicable. This year’s report covers information related to healthcare, transportation, education, employment, and several other key social areas.
