**S﻿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

This paper is revised and republished from May 18, 2000. It did not include new recommendations.  It highlighted actions nestled within earlier NCD recommendations that can serve as the catalyst for developing and implementing new action plans.  NCD's 1993-2000 report recommendations called for Administrative, Congressional, and/or federal agency actions to enhance positive outcomes in the lives of all un-served and under-served people, including people with disabilities from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds.  In essence, NCD recommended actions that embrace creative approaches, emphasize integrated resolutions, and can strengthen relationships among broad coalitions of disability, civil, and human rights entities in ways that can ultimately benefit all Americans.
