**S﻿COPE AND PURPOSE:**

When the National Council on Disability (NCD) invited public participation in the Native American Forum (Native Forum) held April 15, 2004 at the Santa Ana Pueblo Hyatt Regency Tamaya Hotel and Resort near Bernalillo, New Mexico, the purpose was to provide a dialogue opportunity for learning about issues and concerns linked to federal policy. In his delivery of the charge to forum discussion groups, NCD's Cultural Diversity Advisory Committee Liaison, Milton Aponte indicated that the Native Forum was less about one size fits all solutions and "more about trying to obtain authentic perspectives from \[the participants]." NCD wanted to learn directly from people with disabilities, their families, other advocates, tribal and state leaders, service providers and other disability professionals.
