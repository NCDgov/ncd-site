Public participation during the public comment period provides an opportunity for us to hear from individuals, businesses, providers, educators, parents and advocates. Your comments are important in bringing to the Council's attention the issues and priorities of the disability community.

Additional information on specifics of the topic is available on NCD's public comment page at https://ncd.gov/​public-comment.

The Council will receive comments from in-person commenters first, and time allowing, from Florida residents who attend via Zoom for Government livestream. Comments are also always accepted via email.

To provide public comment during an NCD Council Meeting, NCD requires advanced registration by either signing up to present while registering for the meeting or sending an email to

Comments during this meeting must be specific to youth in nursing homes and experiences in recent natural disasters.

To provide comments by email, please send personal experiences, and/or articles, data, and other research on the following topics to PublicComment@ncd.gov.

Your contributions will help strengthen our investigations and provide for a more comprehensive view for federal policymakers.

I. Youth and Younger Adults With Disabilities in Nursing Homes

This project seeks to uncover the drivers of the growing population of youth and younger adults with disabilities living in nursing homes and explore policy solutions that seek to keep youth and younger adults with disabilities in their communities where they can live, learn, and seek employment. Responses to any of the following questions are helpful.

1. What number of people with disabilities ages 21-40 are receiving LTSS in nursing homes? How large is the subset of those under age 21? What are the numbers by state? What are the demographics? What is the average length of stay? What placements were made out of state?

2. What data gaps exist on these questions and how could the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) improve them? What reporting could HHS or HUD require of federal fund recipients to obtain data on people with disabilities age 40 and under in nursing homes?

3. How many people are estimated to be on waiting lists to transfer out of nursing facilities are ages 21-40 and under 21? What federal and state policies assist in gathering this information and what are the federal and state barriers?

4. Are there existing federal and state policies that have the effect of routing younger people with disabilities into nursing homes? (Please note that NCD is not seeking information on what keeps people with disabilities from leaving nursing facilities as we have well-established research on that topic).

5. What impact has Money Follows the Person had on nursing home diversion for younger people with disabilities? Please provide specific examples to the degree possible. What other programs are successful at diversion of younger people with disabilities from nursing homes?

6. What opportunities are available to younger people with disabilities who reside in nursing homes, for free appropriate public education (FAPE), recreation, community participation? What are the results of unavailability/restricted availability of the activities?

7. How could policymakers specifically address the needs of younger people with disabilities in LTSS and housing policy?

II. Improving the Outcome of People With Disabilities During and After Disasters

This project focuses on how state and local governments execute their emergency management plans; identifies promising practices; and provides resources and recommendations. Comments on any of the following questions are helpful.

1. What elements are lacking in state and local disaster preparation plans that would mitigate the adverse impact of disaster recovery and response on people with disabilities?

2. How do states encourage local emergency management operators to be inclusive of people with disabilities before, during and after disasters?

3. What is FEMA's role and responsibility to ensure people with disabilities needs are included in disaster preparation at the local level?



4. What states have an infrastructure that promotes the inclusivity of people with disabilities?
