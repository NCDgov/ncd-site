### S﻿ubmit your public comment to NCD

Your participation during the public comment period provides an opportunity for us to hear from you—individuals, businesses, providers, educators, parents and advocates. Your comments are important in bringing attention to issues and priorities of the disability community and informing the work of NCD.

**Next Public Comment Opportunity:**

Thursday, May 29, 2025, from 4 to 4:45 p.m. EDT during NCD's Council Meeting.

**Topic(s):** Youth and younger adults in nursing homes; 2025 Progress Report notable policy developments

For the May 29 Council meeting, NCD will have a public comment period of 45 minutes and requests comments from the public regarding the experiences of youth and younger adults in nursing homes and for our 2025 Progress Report focused on what the public considers the most notable disability policy developments since Summer 2024. The Council would also like to hear about any missed opportunities within those achievements.

Information on our Council meeting is available on our [Upcoming Event page](https://www.ncd.gov/meeting/2025-05-29-may-29-30-2025-council-meeting/).

Public comment will be used to further develop the information in NCD’s reports, HCBS Ecosystem (2022), Deinstitutionalization: Unfinished Business (2012); NCD communications with Congress and the Department of Health and Human Services regarding institutionalization and HCBS; and the 2021 Progress Report: The Broadscale Impacts of Covid-19 on People with Disabilities. It will fill a gap in the existing knowledge about younger people with disabilities in nursing homes by describing policies and events that contribute to nursing home placement, presenting state and federal data on the amount of younger people residing in nursing homes and describing the impacts on their lives. Finally, it will provide recommendations to federal and state agencies on improving existing policies and causes that result in the institutionalization of younger people with disabilities, particularly the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and state Medicaid agencies. 

**Research Questions** 

* What number of people with disabilities ages 21-40 are receiving LTSS in nursing homes? How large is the subset of those under age 21? What are the numbers by state? What are the demographics? What is the average length of stay?  
* What data gaps exist on these questions and how could the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) improve them? What reporting could HHS or HUD require of federal fund recipients to obtain data on people with disabilities age 40 and under in nursing homes?  
* How many people are estimated to be on waiting lists to transfer out of nursing facilities are ages 21-40 and under 21? How have these numbers changed over the past 10 years? What are the best sources for this data? 
* Are there existing federal and state policies that have the effect of routing younger people with disabilities into nursing homes? Are they the same as those that keep them there? 
* What impact has Money Follows the Person had on nursing home diversion for younger people with disabilities? Please provide specific examples to the degree possible. What other programs are successful at diversion of younger people with disabilities from nursing homes?  
* What opportunities are available to younger people with disabilities who reside in nursing homes, for free appropriate public education (FAPE), recreation, community participation?  
* What are examples of non-governmental initiatives to help move children out of nursing homes? What states house the most children in nursing homes? What are the main causes? What is the remedy? 
* How could policymakers address the needs of younger people with disabilities in LTSS and housing policy so that nursing home placement is minimized?
