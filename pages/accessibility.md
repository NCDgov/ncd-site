**Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. § 794d)**

The National Council on Disability is committed to making its information and communication technologies accessible to individuals with disabilities by meeting or exceeding the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

Section 508 is a federal law that requires agencies to provide individuals with disabilities access to electronic and information technology and data comparable to those who do not have disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. To meet this commitment, NCD's web pages are being designed to meet or exceed the Section 508 standards and conform to the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, Level AA.

The Section 508 standards are the technical requirements and criteria that are used to measure conformance with the law. More information on Section 508 and the technical standards can be found at [www.section508.gov](http://www.section508.gov/). The W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 can be found at [www.w3.org/tr/wcag20](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).
