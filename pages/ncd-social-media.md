The National Council on Disability uses numerous social media accounts to provide you with information in more places and more ways. We use social media accounts to share news, make information and services more widely available, and increase government transparency.

It’s important to remember that these are commercial sites and are not required to follow government standards. It’s always a good idea to be familiar with the privacy policies and rules of these sites.
