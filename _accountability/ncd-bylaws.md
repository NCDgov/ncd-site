This delegated authority shall encompass such actions as may be required to implement the programs or policies adopted at a Council meeting, as well as any powers required to facilitate the administration of the Council.

 (3)       This section shall not be construed to grant any authority to the Executive Committee  to bind the Council beyond the direction of the Council as may be reasonably inferred from Council meetings.

(4)        This section should not be construed as granting Executive Committee oversight of, or in any way governing the exercise by, the Executive Director of such powers and responsibilities expressly or implicitly delegated to that position.

F.         Binding Actions in the name of the Council Absent Specific Direction or Delegation from the Council.

(1)        In general, the Executive Committee  shall not take action beyond Sections 6.2.D and 6.2.E and should not function as a routine decision-making body in lieu of the full Council. There will nonetheless arise, on occasion, time-sensitive situations in which it may be in the best interests of the Council to take swift action but where it is impractical or impossible to convene a quorum of the Council before such action must be taken to be effective.

(2)        This section expressly authorizes the Executive Committee  to take actions that bind the Council in time-sensitive situations, but only to the extent the Executive Committee  makes an informed judgment that taking such action is consistent with the Council’s priorities and general direction and conforms to section 6.2.F.(3) below.  When such situations arise, the Executive Committee  shall first make a preliminary determination as to whether or not the proposed action commends full deliberation at a meeting of the Council irrespective of the preference to act swiftly.

(3)        In general, the  Executive Committee  shall not take actions under this section, 6.2.F, unless a) time-sensitive action is required; and b) such action could not reasonably be interpreted by Council Members to bind the Council to a policy position or other action not previously encompassed in or readily extrapolated from the Council’s prior deliberations or publications, or otherwise exceed the scope of actions reasonably contemplated by the Council as falling within this authority.

(4)        A determination by the Executive Committee pursuant to 6.2.F(2) and 6.2.F(3) that action under this section is warranted requires concurrence of the four members of the Executive Committee.

(5)        When the Executive Committee of  has determined taking an action to bind the Council under this section is warranted, the Executive Committee  shall give notice of the action contemplated to the full Council and consult with such individual Council Members or established committees as are determined to have significant interest or expertise for guidance about the substantive action to be taken.

(6)        Upon the unanimous decision of all members of the Executive Committee to invoke the authority given to the committee under this Section, a simple majority of the Executive Committee shall be sufficient to take a specific action. Actions taken pursuant to this Section bear the authority of the full Council because any such actions must, by definition, be consistent with Council action taken at a Council Meeting.

(7)        The Council may establish and amend from time-to-time specific guidelines for exercise of this authority, including specific examples of types of actions that may or may not be permitted under this Section. The Council may also adopt and maintain a list of principled positions on disability policy, with which any actions taken under this Section must be consistent.

G.        Ultra Vires Exercise of Power. Any and all Council powers not expressly delegated by the Council to the  Executive Committee  remain vested with the full Council, or any other individual to whom the Council has delegated such power.  If a majority of the Council Members object to any action of the Executive Committee  on the ground that it has exceeded the lawful delegation of power to the Executive Committee  in these bylaws or by operation of any applicable law or regulation, such action shall be stayed to the maximum extent feasible until a quorum of the Council is convened. However, any action taken by the Executive Committee  pursuant to these Bylaws shall be effective whenever so specified and is not dependent on documented absence of objection. The Executive Committee  shall not seek to avoid scrutiny by hastening implementation before any reasonable objection can be registered.

**Section 6.3     Committee on Tribal Lands, Indigenous People and the Territories.**

A.         There shall be a standing committee on Tribal Lands, Indigenous People and the Territories to ensure that the work of the Council incorporates issues specific to these communities.

B.         The Chairperson shall appoint three Council Members to serve on the committee, and a chair of the committee.

C.        The chair of the committee shall be responsible for convening and conducting meetings of the committee and for reporting back to the Council on activities and recommendations of the committee.

**ARTICLE 7 - POLICY REPORTS; ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT**

**Section 7.1 Annual Progress Report.**        

A.         Pursuant to the Council’s Authorizing Statute, the Council shall, no later than October 31, prepare and submit to the President and the appropriate committees of the Congress a report entitled "National Disability Policy: A Progress Report“ (Progress Report).

B.         The Progress Report shall assess the status of the country in achieving the policies set forth in section 400(a)(2) \[29 USCS § 780(a)(2)], with particular focus on the new and emerging issues impacting on the lives of individuals with disabilities. The Progress Report shall present, as appropriate, available data on health, housing, employment, insurance, transportation, recreation, training, prevention, early intervention, and education. The Progress Report shall include recommendations for policy change. 

C.        At the first quarterly meeting of each calendar year, the Council shall actively solicit input from the disability community (including, but not limited to, individuals with disabilities, representatives of organizations representing a broad range of individuals with disabilities, and organizations and agencies interested in individuals with disabilities), to identify and prioritize the issues and concerns affecting the disability community. .

D.        The Council shall consider the input received from the community during that meeting and engage in a deliberative process to determine the topic for the Council’s Progress Report. The determined topic for the Progress Report shall be based on the issues and priorities identified by the disability community, as well as the Council’s assessment of the significance, urgency and impact of those issues.  .

**Section 7.2     Policy Reports.**

A.         In addition to the Progress Report, the Executive Committee shall determine, with input from the Executive Director and the Agency Staff, the number of additional policy reports, if any, the Council shall endeavor to issue in each fiscal year.

B.         If the Executive Committee votes to approve the development of one or more policy reports in addition to the Progress Report, each Council Member shall have the opportunity to submit one or more proposals of topics for policy reports for the Council to be authored during the next fiscal year.

C.        Council Members are encouraged to consult with the disability community when arriving at those topics, in order to ensure that the reports are responsive to the needs and concerns of the disability community.

D.        The proposals shall be submitted in writing to the Chairperson and the Director of Policy, in a format as directed by the Director of Policy, no later than a date as established by the Director of Policy in consultation with the Executive Director.

E.         All proposals timely submitted shall be included in meeting materials for the Council’s next quarterly meeting and disseminated to applicable staff by the Policy Director. At that Council meeting, Council Members tendering one or more report proposals shall present their proposal(s) to the Council Members for their consideration and vote.

F.         Pursuant to the voting requirements set forth in these Bylaws, the Council Members shall vote to approve one or more policy reports to be issued by the Council in the subsequent fiscal year. The topic (or if the Executive Committee voted to approve more than one policy report) topics receiving the most votes shall serve as the slate of reports that the Council shall issue in the next fiscal year.
