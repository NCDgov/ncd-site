## National Council on Disability EEO Policy Statement ([PDF](https://www.ncd.gov/assets/uploads/docs/EEO-Policy-Statement-FY25))

April 9, 2025

The mission of the National Council on Disability (NCD) is to serve as a trusted advisor, in collaboration with people with disabilities to the President; Congress; Federal entities; State, tribal communities, and local governments; and other entities and organizations. Fundamental to this mission is the obligation to honor the diversity of NCD’s workforce and treat all employees with respect and dignity. NCD promotes Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), to encourage a climate that capitalizes on the diversity and professionalism of our workforce. Discriminatory or harassing behavior will not be tolerated at NCD.

Pursuant to the anti-discrimination statutes, including (but not limited to) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, (“Title VII”) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, employment decisions at NCD are based on equal employment opportunity for all employees and applicants for employment, regardless of their race, religion, color, sex (including pregnancy, sex, national origin, age, genetic information, disability, retaliation, or any other status protected by federal laws and regulations. Accordingly, these protections extend to all management practices and decisions, including, but not limited to, recruitment and hiring practices, transfers, reassignments, benefits, separations, appraisal systems, merit promotions, training and career development programs. All employees will have the freedom to compete on a fair and level playing field with equal opportunity for competition.

To this end, in accordance with the anti-discrimination statutes, and EEOC guidance, NCD promotes an environment free of discrimination and any form of harassment, where all employees may work without fear of reprisal; where all employees and applicants with qualified disabilities and targeted disabilities receive reasonable accommodations, so they can be successful at their work; and where all employees are recognized for their individual performance and contributions to NCD.

Additionally, NCD remains equally committed to the full and meaningful implementation of EEO policies for all NCD employees and applicants consistent with applicable federal civil rights laws. Keeping this commitment will ensure NCD prevents, stops, and remedies all forms of discrimination or harassment that may occur within NCD. Examples of prohibited conduct include: making abusive, derisive, profane, or harassing statements; using epithets or slurs; engaging in stereotyping or intimidating acts; making or sharing racially derisive social media posts; and circulating or posting of written or graphic materials that show hostility toward individuals regardless of their protected status.



Managers and supervisors are expected to respond appropriately to allegations of discrimination or harassment and are required to uphold governing laws, regulations, and this policy. They must ensure that workplace discrimination or harassment is not tolerated and is corrected before it becomes severe or pervasive. Therefore, managers and supervisors will complete periodic required training to ensure they clearly understand their roles and responsibilities in addressing and eliminating all forms of discrimination or harassment.



Employees who believe they are experiencing unlawful discrimination or harassment should bring their concerns to the attention of their supervisor, a member of their management team, or to their servicing EEO office. Additionally, retaliation in any form against an employee who reports unlawful discrimination or harassment is strictly prohibited as NCD will not tolerate workplace harassment or reprisal against anyone who engages in protected activity.



All employees and applicants must be able to exercise their right to elect the EEO process, to oppose discriminatory practices, and to engage in whistleblowing or exercise any other right provided by law, without fear of retaliation. EEO claims should be initiated by contacting the agency’s EEO counselor/official (NCD’s HR Servicing provider and EEO assistance is at GSA CABS gsacabs@gsa.gov) within 45 days of the alleged harassment or discrimination. An employee is not required to wait until NCD’s internal investigation is completed to file a complaint with EEOC. Additionally, employees may report allegations of reprisal for whistleblowing to the Office of Special Counsel at https://osc.gov/ or 1-800-872-9855.
